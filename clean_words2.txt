something
that
the
rest
regretENDSENT
BEGINSENTThen
I
hopped
inside

punch
them
I
couldnt
help
itENDSENT
BEGINSENTNow
Im

I
can
say
what
it
isENDSENT
BEGINSENTIts
parents
that

pin
it
to
they
facesENDSENT

Duff
are
the
only
ones
with
enoughENDSENT
BEGINSENTTo
feel
what
Im
about
to
say
in
this
songENDSENT
BEGINSENTWhen
they
want
you
to
be
like
somebody
else
and
you
just
want
to
be
yourselfENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
you
do
it
and
get
the
feeling
its
wrongENDSENT
BEGINSENTThat
there
is
when
all
the
press
articles
happening
and
the
cameras
get
to
snappingENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
they
try
to
make
you
out
as
a
lieENDSENT
BEGINSENTSymbolic
because
you
were
just
trying
to
please
them
by
using
logic
and
reasonENDSENT
BEGINSENTIts
a
lose
lose
why
even
tryENDSENT
BEGINSENTWhen
your
ideas
so
frequently
get
rejected
people
just
get
neglectedENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
they
never
really
know
how
to
feelENDSENT
BEGINSENTPhone

something
that
youre
expecting
for
someone
without
the
ethicsENDSENT

the
motives
to
try
and
make
them
a
millENDSENT
BEGINSENTYou
never
noticed
the
fact
you
might
be
working
without
receiving
the
perks
andENDSENT
BEGINSENTNiggas
wanna
say
that
you
aint
aroundENDSENT
BEGINSENTI
mean
theres
always
some
blame
to
put
on
yourself
instead
of
claimingENDSENT
BEGINSENTthat
you
couldnt
help
and
maybe
next
time
you
aint
in
townENDSENT
BEGINSENTYou
gonna
try
to
try
harder
cuzENDSENT
BEGINSENTTry
harder

you
succumb
to
pressure

most
of
these
rappers
running

Ive

to
sign
to
RocAFella
twiceENDSENT
BEGINSENTHaters

they
heardENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
we
laugh
soon
as
you
come
and
tell
me
like
Im
Ellen
BriceENDSENT
BEGINSENTMy
groove
theory
is
that
when
you
too
cheeryENDSENT
BEGINSENTThey
try
to
bring
you
down
to
the
level
they
atENDSENT
BEGINSENTWell
when
they
are
all
unhappy
then
it
gets
a
little
stickyENDSENT
BEGINSENTThats
why
I
am
Little
Nicky
to
these
devils
in
rapENDSENT
BEGINSENTBut
uh
they
aint
thinking
Drake
get
smart
girlENDSENT
BEGINSENTNah
they
probably
think
Ill
break
your
heart
girlENDSENT
BEGINSENTHaha
I
cant
lie
you
probably
right
about
itENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
if
you
give
me
the
ass
quick
Ill
probably
write
about
itENDSENT
BEGINSENTBut
I
hate
it
when
they
judge
me
on
how
I
soundENDSENT
BEGINSENTI
mean
I
spit
that
influential
shit
from
my
townENDSENT
BEGINSENTI
dont
know
why
you
sitting
on
the
couchENDSENT
BEGINSENTWhen
you
see
I
got
a
bed
bring
your
ass
here
and
lie
downENDSENT
BEGINSENTYou
think
taking
your
purse
offENDSENT
BEGINSENTWill
lead
to
me
you
taking
shirts
off
and
then
your
skirt
offENDSENT
BEGINSENTAt
least
I
got
status
because
I
couldve
been
a
local
emceeENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
you
probably
wouldve
been
worse
offENDSENT
BEGINSENTSo
Im
a
take
this
hat
off
and
Im
a
hit
it
till
I
backs
offENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
then
Im
back
sorrowfulENDSENT
BEGINSENTCause
you
thinking
you
can
predict
what
happenENDSENT
BEGINSENTYou
the

BEGINSENTAs
if

out
a
movie
roleENDSENT
BEGINSENTTalking
bullshit
as

BEGINSENTAnd
I

heart
to
give

niggaz
the
cue
to
goENDSENT

kicking
out
feedbackENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
I
entertain
it

if

need
thatENDSENT
BEGINSENTI
had
a
talk
with
my
uncle
and
he
agreed
thatENDSENT
BEGINSENTMy
privacy
about
the
only
thing
I
need
backENDSENT
BEGINSENTBut
Its
hard
thinkin
in
polite
flows/ENDSENT
BEGINSENTWhen
Stephano
Polato
suits
are
your
night
clothesENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
Jordan
sweat
suits
are
you
flight
clothesENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
you
still
make
it
even
when
they
say
your
flight
closeENDSENT
BEGINSENTEyes
hurting
from
the
camera
phone
light
showsENDSENT
BEGINSENTLife
was
so
full
now
the
shit
just
been
lypodENDSENT
BEGINSENTAlways
said
Ill
say
it
all
on
the
right
trackENDSENT
BEGINSENTBut
in
this
game
you
only
lose
when
you
fight
backENDSENT
BEGINSENTBlack
diamond
bracelets
showing
you
the
basicsENDSENT
BEGINSENTI
cant
live
and
hold
the
camera
someone
got
to
tape
thisENDSENT
BEGINSENTI
make
hits
and
like
a
bitch
thats
married
I
aint
missENDSENT
BEGINSENT24
hours
from
greatness
Im
that
closeENDSENT
BEGINSENTDont
ever
forget
the
moment
you
began
to
doubtENDSENT
BEGINSENTTransitioning
from
fitting
in
to
standing
outENDSENT
BEGINSENTLos
Angeles
Cabanas
or
Atlanta
SouthENDSENT
BEGINSENTWatch
Hovs
show
embarrassed
to
pull
my
camera
outENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
my
mother
embarrassed
to
pull
my
Phantom
outENDSENT
BEGINSENTSo
I
park
about
5
houses
downENDSENT
BEGINSENTShe
say
I
shouldnt
have
it
until
I
have
the
crownENDSENT
BEGINSENTBut
I
dont
want
to
feel
the
need
to
wear
disguises
aroundENDSENT
BEGINSENTSo
she
wonders
where
my
mind
is
accounts
in
the
minusENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
yet
I
role
around
the
fucking
city
like
ya
highnessENDSENT
BEGINSENTGot
niggaz
reacting
without
a
sinusENDSENT
BEGINSENTCause
what
Im
working
with
is
timelessENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
promoters
trying
to
get
me
out
to
they
clubENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
say
I
have
fun
but
I
cant
imagine
howENDSENT
BEGINSENTCause
I
just
see
my
ex
girl
standing
with
my
next
girl
standing
with
the
girl
that
Im
fucking
right
nowENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
shit
can
get
weird
unless
they
all
downENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
so
I
stay
clear
we
from
a
small
townENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
everybody
talks
and
everybody
listenENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
somehow
the
truth
just
always
comes
up
missingENDSENT
BEGINSENTIve
always
been
something
that
these
labels
cant
buyENDSENT
BEGINSENTEspecially
if
they
trying
to
take
a
piece
of
my
soulENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
Silvia
be
telling
Taz
damn
Drake
flyENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
he
just
be
like
silly
motherfucker
I
knowENDSENT
BEGINSENTThat
was
your
bad
how
can
you
pass
up
on
emENDSENT
BEGINSENTHe
just
take
them
records
and
he
gas
up
on
emENDSENT
BEGINSENTWayne
would
probably
put
a
million
cash
up
on
emENDSENT
BEGINSENTSurprised
no
one
ever
put
your
ass
up
on
emENDSENT
BEGINSENTOh
they
did
Po
at
least
they
tried
toENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
thats
what
happen
when
you
spitting
what
inside
youENDSENT
BEGINSENTBut
slip
up
and
shoot
the
wrong
fucking
videoENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
they
think
they
can
market
you
however
they
decide
toENDSENT
BEGINSENTNah
before
they
told
me
to
do
meENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
dont
listen
to
anybody
that
knew
meENDSENT
BEGINSENTCause
to
have
known
me
would
mean
that

a
new
meENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd

you
think
I
changed
in
the
slightest
could
have

BEGINSENTAnd
I
could
use
a
writer
to
balance
out
my
flowsENDSENT
BEGINSENTBut
I
never
share
my
thoughtsENDSENT
BEGINSENTThis
is
all

a
chance
to
remembered
and
reprisedENDSENT
BEGINSENTAnd
I
would
be
performing

BEGINSENTOr
further
back

Summer
a
Michael

with
my
mommas
debitENDSENT
BEGINSENTA
weak
attempt
at
flexing
Ill
never
forget
itENDSENT
BEGINSENTCause
that
night
I
played
her
three
songsENDSENT
BEGINSENTThen
we
got
to
talking
bout
something
we
disagreed
onENDSENT
BEGINSENTThen
she
started
telling
me
how
Ill
never
be
as
big
as
Trey
SongzENDSENT
BEGINSENTBoy
was
she
wrong
that
was
just
negative
energy
for
me
to
feed
offENDSENT
BEGINSENTNow
its
therapeutic
blowing
money
in
The

BEGINSENTOr
Beverly

areaENDSENT
BEGINSENTYou
know
hun
Im
a
bit
concerned
about
this
negative
tone
that
Im
hearing
in
your
voice
these
days
I
can
appreciate
where
your
uncertainly
stems
from
and
you
have
reason
to
question
your
anxieties
and
how
disillusioned
you
feel
as
well
as
feeling
skeptical
about
who
you
believe
you
can
trust
But
that
attitude
will
just
hold
you
back
in
this
life
and
youre
going
to
continue
to
feel
alienated
Give
some
thought
to
this
because
Im
confident
in
you
and
I
know
you
can
reach
your
desired
destination
and
accomplish
your
goals
much
more
quickly
without
this
confrontation
Im
hearing
in
your
tone
these
days

others
go
low

high
