Getting

A
lot
of
rappers
in
my
city
they

saying
nothin
A
lot
of
records
from

they
get
no
play
And
these
labels
dont
give
advances
so
you
get
no
pay
Them
little
rims
on
the
ride
Imma
let
those
stay
So
these
nosy
niggas
wont
know
that
I
get
checks
all
day
Whats
he
worth
Fans
keep
trying
on
guessing
My
record
aint
even
finish
they
keep
trying
to
press
it
Boi1da
and
Drake
if
theres
beef
I
address
it
And
the
black
Phantom
is
here
soon
as
we
find
our
exit
Both
of
the
deals
nothing
under
a
mill
We
know
you
got
it
to
give
and
we
trying
to
collect
it
Long
as
I
got
me
some
heat
through
the
winter
Drake
known
as
a
pro
Imma
teach
you
beginners
Bout
to
ink
with
a
major
like
sheets
through
a
printer
For
features
yall
better
get
me
while
its
cheaper
than
dinner
Cause
me
and
1da
trying
to
get
at
your
girl
If
you
see
her
tell
this
nigga
got
some
beats
Imma
sell
her
Check
the
verses
Im
writing
you
might
wanna
learn
it
You
hatin
my
song
but
your
wife
wanna
burn
it
So
now
you
at
the
store
for
some
blank
CDs
You
cant
see
me
for
your
sake
might
wanna
return
it
Cause
if
you
bring
them
discs
home
to
ya
girl
shell
forget
you
And
Ill
be
the
only
one
she
concerned
with
To
the
people
that
ignored
me
before
this
This
one
is
for
you
as
a
song
rerecorded
Funny
thing
is
you
just
notice
me
now
But
I
was
here
along
your
visions
just
been
distorted
and
I
write
a
sixteen
and
record
it
The
waiting
is
over
I
think
music
need
it
Drake
cuttin
his
records
without
gettin
weeded
People
in
the
South
want
it
chopped
and
screwed
I
got
this
dude
They
expectations
Imma
exceed
it
Like
a
singer
with
only
backgrounds
yall
record
it
When
its
done
ya
lyrics
tend
to
mislead
shit
Finally
here
Imma
star
with
the
timing
My
swagger
is
chill
and
my
flow
is
reclining
This
for
anybody
thats
searchin
for
cash
And
purchase
so
fast
you
only
get
the
dough
when
you
grindin
And
so
I
grind
like
Im
listening
to
all
Wayne
My
pain
you
can
experience
through
the
rhyming
boy
Two
years
ago
a
friend
of
mine
Asked
me
to
kick
some
new
school
lines
And
so
I
sent
him
a
rhyme
it
was
fresh
to
death
Now
not
signing
me
is
something
that
the
rest
regret
Then
I
hopped
inside
the
Cadillac
The
chauffeur
drove
off
and
we
never
came
back
lyrics
Southern
Smoke
Its
Southern
Smoke
baby

My
man
Nickelus
F

Ho
Its
Drake
Southern
Smoke

This
is
the
remix
right
here

So
if
you
got
some

Put
ya
hands
in
the
air

Southern
Smoke
Nowadays
you
sayin
that
I
should
go
Jermaine
I
should
go
Pharrell
Either
or
my
nigga
make
sure
you
dont
get
shelled

Make
sure
your
moneys
right
and
they
do
a
promotion
well
So
you
could
get
checks
cut
like
Benedict
in
Oceans
Twelve
This
aint
Brad
Pitt
I
gotta
admit
Im
sick
of
seeing
chicks
in
that
Louis
V
and
that
Plaid
shit
cause
its
a
bad
fit
They
say
my
father
lives
through
me
so
this
is
just
basically
how
my
dad
spit
I
know
my
cash
come
quick
when
its
sunny
You
know
a
girl
is
special
if
I
stick
with
her
honey
If
it
wasnt
for
dummies
chick
would
still
have
money
And
if
it
wasnt
for
money
Nick
would
still
have
Skummy
So
guess
its
kinda
like
a
gift
and
a
curse
To
jip
money
is
easier
than
liftin
a
purse
If
you
pick
the
wrong
mother
wholl
snatch
you
run
for
cover
A
week
later
you
might
find
ya
click
in
a
hearse
boy
I
take
time
arrange
that

Some
kill
just
to

Switch

Of
Times

She
Barely
Replied

And
Shes
Like
Wheres
My
Hi
I
Swear
That
I
Never
Called
You
Cause
I
Really
Get
Shy
See
That
Was
A
Segue
I
Believe
The
Matter
Is
What
Happens
After
The
Seaon
Where
The
Leaves
Just
Scatter
Where
The
Timb
Laces
Get
Tighter
And
Parka
Hoods
Flip
Up
Drugs
Dealers
Standin
And
They
Parka
Hoods
Slip
Up
Where
Girls
Become
Exes
From
Summers
Caught
Hoin
The
Winter
Cars
Come
Out
The
Summer
Cars
Go
In
And
Some
Places
Is
Breezy
And
Some
It
Start
SnowIng
And
If
You
Planning
Family
Vacations
You
Better
Know
When
But
Some
Mothers
Scared
To
Send
They
Daughters
Out
The
City
Instead
She
Get
A
Sweater
That
She
Bought
Her
Out
Of
Pity
Cause
Mom
Stays
Up
Late
She
Seen
Them
Videos
Where
Cancun
College
Students
Pouring
Water
On
Their
Titties
Yeah
Man
Its
A
Funny
Thing
Going
Through
The
Winter
Up
Here
Man
A
Lot
Of
Girls
Yknow
Wanna
Get
Close
You
Might
Think
They
The
One
But
Just
Wait
Nah
Mean
Take
It
Slow
Forget
To
Mention
This
Girl
That
Never
Gets
To
The
Beach
She
Lives
Just
West
Of
My
Street
And
So
We
Destined
To
Meet
Since
Im
Driving
I
Ask
Her
How
To
Get
The
Suite
She
Doesnt
Answer
Opens
The
Door
And
Just
Gets
In
The
Seat
She
Throws
Her
Bag
In
The
Back
And
Starts
Adjusting
The
Heat
Shes
Bold
But
I
Roll
With
It
Im
Impressed
Cause
Shes
Sweet
Then
She
Says
I
Heard
Your
Song
And
Im
Obsessed
With
The
Beat
I
Mean
The
Lyrics
Are
Good
But
Im
Obsessed
With
The
Beat
I
Love
It
When
Voyce
Sings
And
The
Chorus
Is
Good
Theres
A
Couple
Things
In
The
Song
That
I
Suggest
You
Repeat
Off
This
Im
Kinda
Takin
It
Back
For
A
Second
I
Get
Her
Number
She
Tells
Me
To
Call
Her
After
This
Session
And
So
I
Do
And
Its
Kind
Of
Awkward
The
Surface
Hard
To
Scratch
Until
We
End
Up
Sexin
And
Now
My
Heart
Attached
Im
Thinkin
Off
I
Shouldve
Been
More
Southern
And
Realizing
All
That
She
Wanted
Was
That
Indoor
Lovin
And
Ho
Yeah
Uh
I
Told
Yall
I
Had
A
Story
For
You
Right
Uh
Ya
Man
Its
What
It
Is
And
Now
Im
Proud
To
Have
Her
Like
Montreal
To
The
Frizzench
She
Love
To
Play
Hurt
Like
Carter
Did
On
The
Bizzench
But
My
Boy
Say
Im
Actin
Different
Because
I
Lay
Downtown
And
I
Still
I
Rush
To
Pick
Her
Up
From
Work
And
Fizzench
She
Tellin
Everyone
Imma
Hold
Here
Down
Tell
Everyone
Im
The
Prince
Up
In
This
Cold
Clear
Town
And
Stupid
Me
I
Just
Listen
To
Her
Instead
Of
Wondering
If
This
Is
Really
Gon
Last
Me
The
Whole
Year
Round
But
Then
Spring
Shows
Up
And
Its
Dallas
In
This
Bitch
The
Weather
Starts
To
Resemble
The
Holidays
She
Missed
When
We
Were
Together
It
Seeming
Like
Way
Back
When
Ball
Players
Hop
On
The
Plane
And
Make
It
Way
Back
In
See
She
Used
To
Play
Piana
And
Now
She
Never
Wait
For
Santa
Instead
Of
Saving
For
Marriage
She
Saving
For
Carrabanna
And
Its
A
Shame
She
Had
Me
Convinced
That
She
Couldve
Been
A
Dime
I
Guess
I
Lost
Another
One
To
The
Wintertime
Gimme
A
Second
To
Gather
My
Toughts
Strolling
In
The
Park

And
Watching
Winter
Turn
To
Spriing
Such
A
Beautiful
Day
Man
Yeah
Man
You
Know
We
Had
To
Switch
It
On
em
Right
Strolling
In
The
Park
And
Watching
Winter
Turn
To
Spriing
Im
Still
Standing
On
Two
Feet
Even
After
This
Tragic
Loss
Man
But
I
Got
Something
To
Else
To
Tell
Ya
Baby
I
Remember
Them
Encore
Pms
Breakfast
And
The
Wake
Up
Now
Drakes
Committed
We
Waiting
On
The
Breakup
So
We
Can
Get
Back
To
Them
Cognac
Nights
With
Dress
Codes
And
Light
Skinned
Girls
That
Wont
Act
Right
And
I
Laugh
Cause
My
Previous
Lifestyle
Was
Quite
Wild
The
Winter
Came
And
Blew
His
Cold
Air
Through
Back
Then
Light
Sweaters
And
A
Couple
Drinks
Might
Get
Her
By
The
End
Of
The
Week
I
Would
Know
That
Crew
And
Wed
Assembled
A
Trio
A
Whole
New
Scene
With
Three
Ladies
In
The
Shot
We
Never
Broke
Routine
At
The
End
Of
Every
Cut
When
The
Cameras
Are
Rollin
We
Had
Ladies
Hearts
Always
Gettin
Damaged
And
Stolen
But
This
Summer
Is
Different
Its
A
Two
Man
Operation
Granted
The
Fact
That
We
One
Man
Short
Got
Love
For
Him
He
Can
Watch
This
New
Man
Stop
A
Nation
Cause
Handin
Them
Crack
Is
A
One
Man
Sport
Instead
Of
DressUp
I
Walk
In
Sweat
Pants
And
Chomp
Clinkin
I
Find
A
Girl
We
Step
Dance
And
Calm
Drinkin
The
Face
The
Breast
The
Bras
The
Toes
Im
Still
Solo
And
A
Long
Night
Draws
To
A
Close
Cause
Its
A
Fact
If
She
Come
To
The
Crib
And
I
Get
Some
Ass
Inside
Well
Never
Talk
Again
Scary
And
True
That
Song
Special
I
Recorded
With
Voyce
Well
Its
Like
A
Classified
Its
What
Im
Lookin
For
To
Carry
Me
Through
Yet
I
Cant
Seem
To
Find
A
Heavy
Girl
That
Possesses
It
Only
Wants
A
Friendship
Causing
Me
To
Forget
The
Shit
And
When
They
Talk
About
They
Past
And
Lovers
And
You
Get
Mad
At
The
Though
Of
It
Giving
Ass
To
Others
Yet
You
Find
Peace
With
Yourself
Now
Least
Theres
Some
Room
To
Ride
Theres
Also
Room
For
Improvement
As
Soon
As
June
Arrive
Strolling
In
The
Park
And
Watching
Winter
Turn
To
Spriing
Strolling
In
The
Park
And

lyrics
Southern
Smoke
Yeah
Ho

Drake
Uh
Uh
Ho
Do
that
dance
Do
that
Dance
You
special
girl
dont
leave
me
baby
To
find
another
just
like
you
wont
be
easy
baby
So
at
least
I
know
where
the
ones
at
Baby
just
promise
me
if
you
go
that
youll
come
back
Look
I
ought
to
be
thankful
because
for
women
I
have
plenty
of
love
And
when
it
comes
to
relationships
many
is
stuck
Look
at
50
you
make
love
30
you
have
sex
Somewhere
around
the
tender
age
of
20
you
fuck
Or
maybe
before
Im
here
waiting
to
score
Its
long
gone
like
brothers
having
a
tape
in
their
car
Instead
these
girls
taking
it
raw
Now
they
tell
you
to
do
whatever
you
want
because
its
safe
to
explore
Forget
wait
till
its
right
now
wait
till
its
more
Wait
till
he
get
gets
a
deal
girl
wait
till
the
tour
So
they
dance
to
attract
me
advance
and
attack
me
To
the
point
that
Drake
compare
me
to
Anthony
Mackie
But
once
they
have
my
pants
and
my
khakis
I
tell
them
Im
not
one
for
commitment
and
romancing
exactly
Because
I
hate
waking
up
undressed
with
a
dame
And
guessing
her
name
I
hope
this
shit
is
destined
to
change
Because
you
special
girl
dont
leave
me
baby
To
find
another
just
like
you
wont

promise
me
if

like
I
meet
the
perfect
girl
and
she
put
me
through
some
various
shit
Its
something
that
I
can
rarely
predict
All
I
know
is
that
I
can
never
find
the
love
that
Tyler
Perry
depict
Im
guessing
maybe
Shemar
Moore
isnt
really
all
pure
Maybe
I
lie
to
myself
and
its
like
a
small
cure
I
tell
it
all
to
her
I
gotta
feeling
this
feeling
inside
is
something
its
like
and
cant
be
all
sure
Because
really
What
is
a
window
without
a
car
door
Why
I
cant
settle
for
one
instead
of
all
four
Mu
mind

system
Yea
I

trippin
Nickelus

Richmond

The
Scorpios
Mind
is
not
a
game
to
play
wit
all
day
Ive
been
hated
by
many
wanted
by
plenty
Disliked
by
some
but
confronted
by
none
Since
they
dont
show
me
sincerity
I
load
up
lock
up
Take
shots
at
em
I
guess
you
could
call
it
a
parody
But
compared
to
D
They
onefourth
from
watermelon
to
a
quarter
felon
dude
you
a
pear
to
me
If
thats
not
how
it
is
it
aint
how
it
appear
to
be
You
got
blind
heaters
in
my
sweats
is
a
mind
reader
And
when
the
psychic
get
to
touchin
my
palm
Seein
your
physical
the
things
that
you
never
say
to
me
visible
Especially
when
one
of
your
artist
feelin
threatened
Cause
Im
harnessin
a
weapon
wont
you
pardon
my
reflection
Mirror
mirror
tell
me
why
they
wanna
get
and
scrimmage
To
play
around
to
perfection
Im
the
spittin
image
My
verbal
camp
is
vivid
I
told
you
Im
spittin
image
It
seems
we
often
want
to
start
but
never
get
to
finish
My
verbal
campus
is
Villanova
and
those
of
you
feelin
Hova
And
writing
college
rhymes
but
the
thrill
is
over
Let
me
assist
you
like
a
specialist
So
you
can
pull
it
back
and
try
catch
the
metaphors
and
the
rest
of
this
Its
not
a
problem
wit
X
I
guess
Im
a
pessimist
And
me
and
Julien
we
never
got
the
chance
to
communicate
Instead
of
understanding
its
a
tune
of
hate
The
citys
mine
like
Oklahomas
a
Sooner
state
And
were
gonna
have
to
cross
paths
whether
soon
or
late
So
why
dont
you
walk
up
in
the
spot
using
less
strut
You
aint
Morris
Chestnut
you
lighter
and
less
cut
And
lets
be
honest
by
now
you
should
be
your
own
scholar
You
still
a
protege
thats
the
reason
I
dont
holler
You
got
rappers
being
repetitive
actors
You
stay
ahead
of
the
game
Im
ahead
of
the
practice

Southern
Smoke
Yeah
Ren
MOF
Haha
Its
Drake
man
Its
Drake
manYeah
Ayo
Ren
this
that
gritty
shit
here
man
Ima
half
to
tell
them
about
I
been
through
on
this
know
what
I
mean
HO
Southern
Smoke
Very
few
give
you
that
truth
its
either
they
cant
do
it
with
lyrics
Or
cant
do
it
in
spirit
they
cancel
what
they
doing
The
samples
that
they
using
cant
get
through
the
clearing
Ill
handle
it
since
they
just
cant
get
you
to
hear
it
My
fathers
early
careering
forced
my
parents
to
split
up
My
mother
was
a
teacher
my
father
was
kind
of
fed
up
With
just
being
a
florist
the
choir
sang
his
chorus
And
he
got
back
into
doing
what
he
was
doing
before
us
Because
money
is
an
issue
your
son
he
gon
miss
you
And
plus
you
got
a
wife
at
home
because
mommy
still
exist
too
Now
you
looking
for
exes
you
aint
never
expect
this
You
end
up
doing
time
and
me
I
end
up
with
a
stepsis
Nobody
passing
judgment
or
question
where
the
drugs
went
You
know
I
hold
you
down
because
without
you
Id
be
a
wasnt
And
mommy
Ima
support
her
I
keep
it
all
in
order
See
her
with
tears
in
her
eyes
or
you
arrested
at
the
border
But
I
got
stress
on
my
shoulders
Trying
to
keep
my
heart
pure
but
this
world
is
making
it
colder
Young
black
man
dodge
your
bullets
trying
to
get
older
And
you
wonder
why
we
turn
to
drugs
and
chain
smokers
ITS
STRESS
MY
NIGGA
Im
just
trying
to
live
my
life
cuz
Make
a
little
money
find
a
bunny
to
make
my
wife
cuz
BO
BO
BO
BO
Im
just
trying
to
live
my
life
cuz
Make
a
little
money
find
a
bunny
to
make
my
wife
cuz
BO
BO
BO
BO
This
is
my
life
and
so
the
rest
is
kinda
been
cool
question
what
I
been
through
I
write
a
verse
addressing
it
and
yes
I
might
offend
you
Picture
when
I
was
in
school
Me
being
the
closest
thing
to
black
and
guess
what
rap
music
what
I
was
into
Rest
of
the
kids
were
sheltered
I
never
liked
to
fight
Id
punch
them
I
couldnt
help
it
Now
Im
grown
I
can
say
what
it
is
Its
parents
that
got
these
Black
and
Filipino
nannies
raising
they
kids
And
your
daddy
want
it
very
right
I
make
you
happy
plus
Im
Jewish
he
dont
approve
I
think
he
want
you
to
marry
white
He
want
Sinatra
at
the
wedding
not
Barry
White
Because
black
is
black
honey
even
if
hes
very
light
And
so
I
never
been
for
dinner
at
they
places
Always
brutally
honest
and
so
I
pin
it
to
they
faces
I
live
it
so
the
case
is
whether
Drake
is
Way
ahead
of
his
time
or
inquisitive
and
racist
I
got
stress
on
my
shoulders
Trying
to
keep
my
heart
pure
but
this
world
is
making
it
colder
Young
black
man
dodge
your
bullets
trying
to
get
older
And
you
wonder
why
we
turn
to

and
chain

ITS
STRESS

Im
just
trying

Im

BO
BO

Am
I
hot
as
the
rest
should
I
strive
for
my
spot
as
the
best
Like
girls
with
Double
Ds
I
gotta
lot
on
my
chest
Theres
questions
that
need
to
be
answered
thats
not
on
the
test
Instead
of
staring
at
quizzes

now
its
models
with
breasts
And
yes
when
Im
dismissed
after
a
tedious
listen
I
sit
at
home
and
say
I
should
of
been
a
pediatrician
Homie
I
probably
could
of
been
on
TV
consistent
An
artist
like
Pablo
or
maybe
Peteys
assistant
And
my
mindset
is
come
and
get
me
Im
all
alone
at
home
with
my
mom
and
grandma
and
aint
nobody
running
with
me
So
if
you
got
the
heart
to
come
in
here
and
kill
a
lady
daughter
and
her
grandson
Nigga
get
the
handgun
If
not
you
gon
make
me
call
the
burbs
out
in
Richmond
That
have
you
niggas
laying
out
on
the
curb
they
some
hitmen
Last
couple
of
months
I
done
probably
been
Around
the
world
and
back
and
I
dont
wanna
question
half
the
places
Nick
been
I
got
stress
on
my
shoulders

Trying
to
keep
my
heart
pure
but
this
world
is
making
it
colder

Young
black
man
dodge
your
bullets
trying
to
get
older

And
you
wonder
why
we
turn
to
drugs
and
chain
smokers
Yeah

ITS
STRESS
MY
NIGGA
Im
just
trying
to
live
my
life
cuz
Make

find
a

live
my
life

winded
over

man
Make
a
little

lyrics
Sometimes
I
feel
like
Lohan
and
Hilary
Duff
are
the
only
ones
with
enough
To
feel
what
Im
about
to
say
in
this
song
When
they
want
you
to
be
like
somebody
else
and
you
just
want
to
be
yourself
And
you
do
it
and
get
the
feeling
its
wrong
That
there
is
when
all
the
press
articles
happening
and
the
cameras
get
to
snapping
And
they
try
to
make
you
out
as
a
lie
Symbolic
because
you
were
just
trying
to
please
them
by
using
logic
and
reason
Its
a
lose
lose
why
even
try
When
your
ideas
so
frequently
get
rejected
people
just
get
neglected
And
they
never
really
know
how
to
feel
Phone
calls
is
something
that
youre
expecting
for
someone
without
the
ethics
And
the
motives
to
try
and
make
them
a
mill
You
never
noticed
the
fact
you
might
be
working
without
receiving
the
perks
and
Niggas
wanna
say
that
you
aint
around
I
mean
theres
always
some
blame
to
put
on
yourself
instead
of
claiming
that
you
couldnt
help
and
maybe
next
time
you
aint
in
town
You
gonna
try
to
try
harder
cuz
Try
harder
cuz
Try
TryTryTry
And
the
managers
make
you
succumb
to
pressure
and
you
spitting
is
fresher
than
most
of
these
rappers
running
the
game
Concerned
that
people
who
copy
whats
in
the
past
and
turn
the
profit
with
cash
Theres
time
I
would
have
done
it
the
same
I
mean
I
got
me
a
range
Also
got
me
a
guilty
conscience
That
made
you
tell
anybody
I
meet
that
I
rent
Sometimes
I
wish
that
I
would
just
chilled
on
the
sneakers
and
watched
the
game
from
the
bleachers
Because
Im
really
tend
to
need
what
I
spent
In
a
house
that
I
promised
to
get
my
mother
dont
compensate
for
the
other
time
I
wasted
late
out
at
the
club
Instead
of
sitting
in
once
a
week
for
some
dinner
Im
working
hard
on
the
winner
so
this
album
is
a
labor
of
love
You
say
as
long
as
Im
staying
out
of
the
streets
and
just
spending
money
on
beats
That
she
can
rest
without
a
toss
and
a
turn
Because
she
know
that
my
reputation
perceives
me
and
people
watch
me
on
TV
Thats
exactly
why
I
often
get
burned
But
Im
gonna
try
to
You
gonna
try
to
try
harder
cuz
Try
harder
cuz

You

Tryna

so
honey
heres
a
tip
Nowadays
its
gettin
cheaper
to
put
20s
on
the
whip
So
if
you
a
opportunist
look
for
20s
in
the
clip
And
if
you
find
em
attractive
and
funny
thats
when
you
dip

And

Ya

that
and

third
to

See
me
out
and
they
never
utter
a
word
to
em
Expect
me
not
to
draw
a
card
from
the
deck
Anybody

my
city
going
hard

You

debt

you
choose
not
to
pay
that
Imma
hop

and
collect
lect

It
aint
a
problem
of
concern
bruh
I
always
end
up
with
exactly
what
I
earn
bruh
This
aint
last

money

a
cashier
so
hand
your
receipt
if
you
tryna
make
a
return

Yessir
I

And
I
got

too

She

Christian
Dior
clothes
Like

Me

the
salesman
build
a
rapport
so
He
understands
tha
fact
that
Im
spending
off
shore
dough
Cash
only
transactions
homie
And
please
no

the

explore
those
They
cant
audit
if
they
dont

I
bought
it
I
been
doin
this
for
years
homie
thoroughly
Ive
thought
it
Through
what
it
do
I
am
currently
recorded
on
a
track
admitting
most
of
my
currencys
imported
Were
too
late
now
too
legitimate
to
hit
em
with
Lawsuits
even
if
theyre
crimes
that
I
did
commit
Repeat
offender
Anita
Baker
playin
in
the
whip
as
they
pull
me
over
my
sweet
surrender
I
got
a
Jewish
lawyer
as
my
lead
defender
A
mitchkeit
as
they
say
hes
a
legal
bender
And
ATF
is
present
every
legal
memeber
The
coalition
we
so
efficient
You
have
to
be
invited
or
theres
no
admission
We
know
tradition
We
spend
money
so
dont
try
to
compete
if
youre
in
no
position
I
wish
you
would
listen
I
take
you
back
to
this
trial
Where
I
am
about
to
be
home
again
like
New
Edition
My
foot
is
just
solely
meant
for
this
shoe
it
fits
in
Used
to
record
in
a
basement
that
Rennie
Grew
was
piffin
When
pops
turned
over

like
a
new
ignition
If
Hov
is
Jordan
I
guess
Im
cool
with
Pippen
til
I
mention
that
I
wanna
play
a
new
position
No

screen
settin
Because
I
wanna
win
games
coach
Im
through
assistin
The
take
over
the
breaks
over
nigga
And
Im
a
keep
killin
em
until
the
day
that
Drakes
over
The
waits
over
the
tapes
coming
They
bullshittin
but
I
am
equipped
with
great
plumbing
The
human
mentalitys
so
eager
to
hate
something
I
try
to
play
it
off
like
it
aint
jumpin
And
this
the
predicament
that
you
found
Drake
in
The
condo
that
I
just
purchased
sound
vacant
cause
I
have
just
been
sittin
in
this
cell
Thinkin
what
I
coulda
done
to
make
my
first
video
ground
breaking
And
whenever
Im
flowing
on
the
mic
Aside
from
talkin
bout
the
d
Im
throwin
in
ya
wife
I
treat
this
one
session
as
if
it
was
my
last
And
I
pretend
tomorrow
is
the
day
Im
going
in
for
life
like
that
Ok
there
comes
a
time
when
you
gotta
be
like
You
know
Ive
come
this
far
on
my
own
Done
a
lot
for
myself
Where
to
now
Ya
know
But
I
just
tell
myself
this
one
thing
It
was
worth
it
it
was
all
worth
it
And
by
this
time
I
understand
that
I
aint
perfect
There
aint
a
pair
of
Louis
shoes
I
aint
purchased
And
I
was
on
some
shit
but
they
served
they
purpose
And
I
got
verses
I
got
verses
My
16s
should
be
arriving
in
hearses
They
get
bodied
You
see
how
I
murk
this
I
switch
flows
much
as
my
girl
switch
purses
Yeah
heartbreak
Drake
Ill
put
it
on
your
wife
If
I
put
it
in
a
verse
then
I
put
it
on
my
life
Liquor
thats
over
ice
and
denim
thats
over
priced
And
tryna
make
all
my
goals
for
the
future
come
over
night
Got

Im

Come

season
of
Flight

Concords
And

try
to
put
some
lotion

over

contours
But

You

books
Just

You

vision
correction
Im

And

lyrics
Take

you
want
take
what
you
waahahaant
Take
what
you
want
take
what
you
want
But
you
gotta
share
it
with
the
world
Lately
Ive
been
murdering
and
avoiding
conviction
This
shit
is
like
an
addiction
conflicting
with
what
I
do
Shout
out
to
K
Davis
and
my
connect
up
at
Avis
Cause
every
weekend
Im
rollin
out
stuntin
in
somethin
new
Fortunately
I
am
at
an
elevated
level
Im
celebrated
at
home
and
I
am
high
above
it
all
But
apologies
to
my
fans
that
be
super
conscious
Just
wait
til
I
get
my
money
right
and
I
am
going
to
ball
Ball
ball
Dont
you
have
a
man
Dont
you
got
a
man
Why
are
you
trying
to
be
my
girl
I
cant
believe
it
Dont
you
have
a
man
Dont
you
GOT
a
man
Its
alllllright
with
me
my
girl
We
can
do
anything
Why
you
over
there
lookin
at
me
Why
your
man
standin
right
beside
ya
The
temporary
happiness
he
might
provide
ya
but
you
know
and
I
know
that
nobody
gon
do
ya
like
me
Tryna
say
you
like
a
goalie
in
line
of

I
know
that
I
feel
a
bit
slowly
Im
kinda
like
and
so
she
want
this
chef
stick
like
Napoleon
Dynamite
Well
Ima
give
it
to
you
honeybunches
You
feel
it
all
under
ya
ribs
like
some
tummy
crunches
All
my
other
girls
all
up
on
that
subtle
shit
They
dont
wanna
cut
it
they
wanna
wrap
it
and
cuddle
with
Consequences
keep
weighin
me
down
So
whenever
she
thinks
Im
serious
Im
playin
around
It
gets
deeper
and
coldER
the
funny
thing
is
Im
writin
this
in
my
head
and
she
asleep
on
my
shoulder
like
Lookwe

a
lil
thing
a
wintertime

You

some
hushhush
I

a
future
in

Plus

man

Youll

the
same
things
to
me
My
feelings

late
night

the
place

Late
nights
85
South

But

it
while
she
was
buildin
her
house
a
home
wit
this
new
cat
sayin
that
he

her
right
It
just
proves
that
she
dont
know
what
to
do
wit
her
life
Cause
if
so
she
wouldnt
have
to
change
her
strategy
And
wouldnt
need

her
batteries
One
minute
she
mad

next
minute

and
Im
in
her
body
like
Greys
Anatomy
I
dont
understand
why
God
sent
me
to
you
And
I

to
justify

foul
shit

All

or

quickly
Cant
allow
the
past
to
restrict
me
Bet
this
time
around
they
wont
skip
me
I
am
the
last
hope
Dont
hesitate
not
even
for
a
second
The
hustle
has
become
an
obsession
Im
on
the
front
lines
with
my
weapon
I
am
the
last
hope
Can
you
imagine
the
last
breath
of
Christ
The
last
breath
of
Christopher
Wallace
on
that
faithful
night
The
last
step
that
Martin
Luther
took
as
a
man
I
got
the
power
of
my
world
in
my
hand
The
microphone
brings
life
and
death
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
I
was
born
to
provoke
those
born
to
die
I
was
conceived
to
beat
all
odds
like
Las
Vegas
Tdot
motherfucker
watch
the
world
rape
us
Greatest
strugglers
hustle
to
succeed
Cross
border
smugglers
tussle
to
burn
weed
It
means
that
pressure
of
success
in
the
south
Niggas
watchin
what
I
say
magnifying
my
mouth
I
never
take
back
talk
I
apply
the
force
Hand
blistering
from
many
years
of
holdin
the
torch
When
the
skin
rebuilds
it
grows
tougher
than
leather
So
we
can
keep
on
holdin
it
forever
My
names
Kardinall
Jealousys
suttin
I
havent
felt
for
years
Theres
nobody
around
for
me
to
be
jealous
of
I
bet
you
do
a
show
in
my
city
and
no
one
cheers
Even
if
you
make
the
music
that
ladies
and
fellas
love
and
dove
Im
incredible
fuckin
unforgettable
And
when
it
comes
to
records
I
will
eat
it
if
its
edible
They
say
the
futures
always
foreseen
Thats
why
Im
steady
getting
more
money
more
cream
My
flow
is
stuck
in
the
moment
that
comes
before
dreams
I
stay
avoiding
unlucky
like
14
And
people
get
behind
im
and
they
fight
for
im
Cause
he
wont
let
no
other
niggas
write
for
im
And
even
when
its
quite
warm
The
attitude
coursing
through
the
veins
of
my
city
is
a
ice
storm
The
name
Drake
and
I
dont
take
it
for
granted
I
just
take
it
you
offended
cause
Im
taking
advantage
mayne

what
Im
talking
about
Goin

chat
It

a
boy
like
Hugh
Grant
lyrics
I
swear
to
Lord
same
dudes
use
to
laugh
at
me
See
me
in
the
CL6
with
half
a
bead
They
know
that
money
begets
money
so
naturally
Me
I
have
to
blow
a
couple
stacks
hassle
free
Im
like
fuck
yall
haters
on
behalf
of
me
Cause
I
could
flood
the
city
with
a
staff
of
three
Im
talkin
me
and
two
partners
in
that
caprice
With
no
copies
made
I
got
the
master
keys
And
fast
cars
fast
women
fast
cash
and
cream
Commode
you

the
dream
but
dawg
me
and
success
are
two
things
you
dont
wanna
find
yo
ass
between
Back

the
wall
like
plasma
screens
The
inside
of
my
wallet
is
pastured
green
And
you
are
now
hangin
with
the
asthma
team
Sweetie
catch
your
breath
while
I
smash
the
scene
I
should
leave
earth

Everyday

Christmas

every
night
is
New
Years
Say

Call

walls
But

Family

Girl

shawty
Yeah
9th
Wonder
Dont
judge
me
man
They
tend
to
say
that
us
rappers
are
materialistic
They
say
we
lack
substance
Me
Te
and
El
bout
to
prove
em
wrong
though
Uh
we
know
what
youre
thinking
love
You
think
we
out
smoking
and
drinking
love
Pushing
big
whips
chains
clinking
love
But
yall
dont
really
know
me
like
you
think
you
know
me
We
know
how
you
speculate
Thinking
we
gon
hit
your
friend
if
you
object
to
date
Claim
were
early
and
be
showing
up
extra
late
love
But
yall
dont
really
know
me
like
you
think
you
know
me
Uh
El
be
saying
that
Im
humble
Im
hella
nice
For
that
Ive
been
approached
to
sign
to
RocAFella
twice
Haters
tell
you
all
the
rumors
they
heard
And
we
laugh
soon
as
you
come
and
tell
me
like
Im
Ellen
Brice
My
groove
theory
is
that
when
you
too
cheery
They
try
to
bring
you
down
to
the
level
they
at
Well
when
they
are
all
unhappy
then
it
gets
a
little
sticky
Thats
why
I
am
Little
Nicky
to
these
devils
in
rap
But
uh
they
aint
thinking
Drake
get
smart
girl
Nah
they
probably
think
Ill
break
your
heart
girl
Haha
I
cant
lie
you
probably
right
about
it
And
if
you
give
me
the
ass
quick
Ill
probably
write
about
it
But
I
hate
it
when
they
judge
me
on
how
I
sound
I
mean
I
spit
that
influential
shit
from
my
town
I
dont
know
why
you
sitting
on
the
couch
When
you
see
I
got
a
bed
bring
your
ass
here
and
lie
down
You
think
taking
your
purse
off
Will
lead
to
me
you
taking
shirts
off
and
then
your
skirt
off
At
least
I
got
status
because
I
couldve
been
a
local
emcee
And
you
probably
wouldve
been
worse
off
So
Im
a
take
this
hat
off
and
Im
a
hit
it
till
I
backs
off
And
then
Im
back
sorrowful
Cause
you
thinking
you
can
predict
what
happen
You
the
reason
Im
thinking
Im
getting
sick
of
rapping
You
probably
think
I
walk
around
with
my
gun
tucked
and
Swang
dick
to
these
hoes
like
nunchucks
Well
you
can
think
what
you
want
but
I
think
youve
been
watching
too
much
BET
Uncut
You
need
to
get
real
and
check
out
my
real
life
I
aint
a
tiptrail
dont
care
what
it
smell
like
But
if
you
feel
like
putting
all
your
notions
aside
And
talking
to
a
real
nigga
Id
gladly
oblige
First
name
Phonte
Id
be
pleased
to
date
ya
College
educated
got
degrees
in
papers
But
Im
from
the
South
where
if
you
aint
snapping
Or
rapping
bout
trapping
youse
a
freak
of
nature
Such
an
anomaly
speak
so
well
And
talk
so
collegy
such
an
astonishing
Contrast
to
all
the
bullshit
youve
been
following
On
behalf
of
them
I
offer
my
apologies
Maybe
with
me
youll
unlearn
Putting
all
niggas
in
a
box
of
concerns
Me
cause
I
aint
dumb
shit
Im
well
reared/red
like
sunburn
And
after
me
youll
never
leave
no
stone
unturned
uh
cmon
They
say
you
never
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
Though
you
appear
as
materialistic
just
like
the
others
So
I
followed
your
words
to
take
em
in
And
I
dont
see
what
you
saying
so
they
coming
off
paper
thin
Thats
when
I
felt
that
I
would
need
to
Do
more
than
just
look
you
up
and
down
to
see
if
I
could
read
you
And
try
to
get
inside
your
head
only
Not
just
stick
my
fingers
in
your
middle
to
get
you
to
spread
for
me
So
what
I
learned
on
my
path
to
discover
Your
story
took
one
ugly
turn
after
another
I
saw
we
wasnt
on
the
same
page
I
wouldve
gave
you
strong
play
but
your
words
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
So
now
Im
closing
the
case
You
only
out
for
the
paperback
thats
written
all
over
your
face
No
El
will
never
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
Until
he
seen
what
was
in
between
and
looked
at
what
lies
are
under
I
cant
stop
missing
you
wish
I
was
still
with
you
I
cant
stop
missing
you
NO
NO
NO
NO
I
cant
stop
missing
you
wish
I
was
still
with
you
I
cant
stop
missing
you
NO
NO
NO
NO
Nah
I
never
needed
advice
about
All
the
things
you
liked
to
do
when
it
was
lights
out
I
drove
nice
cars
I
got
a
nice
house
But
now
Im
steady
missing
you
like
a
strikeout
I
always
wished
I
would
of
cared
more
Thats
my
only
feeling
inside
when
ever
I
get
a
song
done
Im
scared
that
every
girl
I
care
for
Will
find
a
better
man
and
end
up
happier
in
the
long
run
Ya
and
when
she
not
by
my
side
And
I
hear
that
she
gone
Now
its
like
a
shock
to
my
pride
I
dont
care
if
she
know
Cause
thats
basically
just
a
male
ego
Speaking
aloud
to
some
real
people
But
you
can
bounce
back
Go
ladies
More
records
more
sex
more
babies

Until
you
find

its
impossible
to
lose

on
my
heart
I

I
start
To
think
That
Im

Throw

Throw

Cause
the
1s

get
her
out
of
Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas

Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas
And

to
this

The

But

And
my
mother
tried
to
runaway
from
home
But
I
left
somethin
in
the
car
so
I
caught
her
in
the
driveway
And
she
cried
to
me
so
I
cried
too
And
my
stomach
was
soaking
wet
She
only
52
And
48
hours
all
before
I
showed
up
And
brought
a
thousand
dollars
worth
of
drinks
and
got
poured
up
Damn
my
reality
just
set
in
And
even
when
the
phantoms
leased
them
hoes
wanna
get
in
I
do
a
lot
of
things
Hoping
I
never
have
to
fit
in
So
trying
to
keep
up
with
my
progress
is
like
a
dead
end
My
girl
love
me
but
fuck
it
my
heart
beat
slow
And
right
now
the
tour
bus
is
lookin
like
a
freak
show
And
life
change
for
us
every
single
week
So
its
good
But
I
know
this
aint
the
peak
though
Cause
I
want
I
want
the
money
Money
and
the
cars
Cars
and
the
clothes
The
hoes
I
suppose
I
just
wanna
be
I
just
wanna
be
Successful
I
just
wanna
be
I
just
wanna
be
Successful
I
just
wanna
be
I
just
wanna
be
Successful
Wise
words
from
a
decent
man
Back
when
I
was
trying
to
put
a
ring
on
Alicia
hand
This
lost
boy
got
fly
without
peter
pan
And
my
delivery
just
got
me
buzzing
like
the
pizza
man
In
person
I
am
everything
and
more
Im
everywhere
these
other
niggas
never
been
before
But
inside
Im
treading
waters
steady
trying
to
swim
ashore
Im
on
a
shoppin
spree
to
get
whatever
is
in
store
Just
call
me
shop
and
bag
drizzy
And
call
me
Mrdamn
he
aint
coping
that
is
he
And
fans
of
these
freshman
is
about
to
get
iffy
While
this
youngin
that
you
doubting
is
about
to
get
busy
Im
a
kill
it
I
promise
this
I
know
you
mad
Ive
always
treated
my
city
like
some
shoulder
pads
To
big
homie
use
a
flash
if
you
must
And
I
swear
I
aint
asking
for
much
All
I
want
is
I
want
the
money
Money
and
the
cars
Cars
and
the
clothes
The
hoes
I
suppose
I
just
wanna
be
I

wanna
be
Successful
I

wanna
be
I
just
wanna
be
Successful
I

be
Successful
Its

to

Pardon

Long

How

I
cant
Miss

woman
like
I
cant
miss
court
dates
Cheese
But
shes
not
in
this
portrait
Lifes

but
I
don
not

Im
on
the
other
side
but
it
is
a
short
gate
I
dont
want
the
glow
I
want
the
glow
ray
And
Im
a
fuck
the
world
But
this
is
just
foreplay
Tired

my
door
Did
you

The
look

But

Did

And

lyrics

Its

a
moment
since
Ive

some
public
speaking
I
find
nowadays
its
just
best
to
keep
quiet
But
uh
sometimes
you
just
gotta
let
it
out
Young
angel
and
young
lion
You
know
what
it
is
uh
Look
Im
the
property
of
October
I
aint
drive
here
I
got
chauffeured
Bring
me
champagne
flutes
Rose
and
some
shots
over
I
think
better
when
Im
not
sober
I
smoke
good
aint
no
glaucoma
Im
a
stockholder
Private
flights
back
home
no
stop
over
Still
spittin
that
shit
that
they

pac
over
The
shit

shocked
over
Yeah

a
canvas
Im

group
of

A
migraine

Excedrin
Im

one
twice
over
Im
the
new

And
if
I
die
Im
a
do
it
reppin
I
never
do
a
second
I
swear
niggas
be
eyeing
me
all
hard
And
lying
to
they
girls
and
driving
the
same
cars
Sittin
there
wishing
they
problems
became
ours
Cause
we
have
nothing
in
common
Since
I
done
became
star
I
done
became
bigger
swerving
right
in
my
peers
lane
Same
dudes
that
used
to
holla
my
engineers
name
One
touch
I
could
make
the
drapes
and
the
sheers
change
An
show
me
the
city
that
I
without
fear
claim
What
I
set
seems
to
never
extinguish
Coolest
kid
out

Chuck
English
Count
my
own
money

the
paper

or
whatever
She

in
the
morn

But
I

get
attracted
to
fans
Cause
the
eager
beaver

be
the
collapse
of
a
dam
I
always
knew
that
I
could
figga
How

Oh
oh
Its
6
oclock
in
the
morning
at
the
studio
Thanks
to
Desiree
for
adding
these
lyrics
Why
do
I
feel
so
alone
Like
everybody
passing
through
the
studio
is
in
character
As
if
he
acting
out
a
movie
role
Talking
bullshit
as
if
it
was
for
you
to
know
And
I
dont
have
the
heart
to
give
these
bitch
niggaz
the
cue
to
go
So
they
stick
around
kicking
out
feedback
And
I
entertain
it
is
if
I
need
that
I
had
a
talk
with
my
uncle
and
he
agreed
that
My
privacy
about
the
only
thing
I
need
back
But
Its
hard
thinkin
in
polite
flows/
When
Stephano
Polato
suits
are
your
night
clothes
And
Jordan
sweat
suits
are
you
flight
clothes
And
you
still
make
it
even
when
they
say
your
flight
close
Eyes
hurting
from
the
camera
phone
light
shows
Life
was
so
full
now
the
shit
just
been
lypod
Always
said
Ill
say
it
all
on
the
right
track
But
in
this
game
you
only
lose
when
you
fight
back
Black
diamond
bracelets
showing
you
the
basics
I
cant
live
and
hold
the
camera
someone
got
to
tape
this
I
make
hits
and
like
a
bitch
thats
married
I
aint
miss
24
hours
from
greatness
Im
that
close
Dont
ever
forget
the
moment
you
began
to
doubt
Transitioning
from
fitting
in
to
standing
out
Los
Angeles
Cabanas
or
Atlanta
South
Watch
Hovs
show
embarrassed
to
pull
my
camera
out
And
my
mother
embarrassed
to
pull
my
Phantom
out
So
I
park
about
5
houses
down
She
say
I
shouldnt
have
it
until
I
have
the
crown
But
I
dont
want
to
feel
the
need
to
wear
disguises
around
So
she
wonders
where
my
mind
is
accounts
in
the
minus
And
yet
I
role
around
the
fucking
city
like
ya
highness
Got
niggaz
reacting
without
a
sinus
Cause
what
Im
working
with
is
timeless
And
promoters
trying
to
get
me
out
to
they
club
And
say
I
have
fun
but
I
cant
imagine
how
Cause
I
just
see
my
ex
girl
standing
with
my
next
girl
standing
with
the
girl
that
Im
fucking
right
now
And
shit
can
get
weird
unless
they
all
down
And
so
I
stay
clear
we
from
a
small
town
And
everybody
talks
and
everybody
listen
And
somehow
the
truth
just
always
comes
up
missing
Ive
always
been
something
that
these
labels
cant
buy
Especially
if
they
trying
to
take
a
piece
of
my
soul
And
Silvia
be
telling
Taz
damn
Drake
fly
And
he
just
be
like
silly
motherfucker
I
know
That
was
your
bad
how
can
you
pass
up
on
em
He
just
take
them
records
and
he
gas
up
on
em
Wayne
would
probably
put
a
million
cash
up
on
em
Surprised
no
one
ever
put
your
ass
up
on
em
Oh
they
did
Po
at
least
they
tried
to
And
thats
what
happen
when
you
spitting
what
inside
you
But
slip
up
and
shoot
the
wrong
fucking
video
And
they
think
they
can
market
you
however
they
decide
to
Nah
before
they
told
me
to
do
me
And
dont
listen
to
anybody
that
knew
me
Cause
to
have
known
me
would
mean
that
theres
a
new
me
And
if
you
think
I
changed
in
the
slightest
could
have
fooled
me
Boy
and
to
my
city
Im
the
Two
Three
Drug
dealers
live
vicariously
through
me
I
quit
school
and
its
not
because
Im
lazy
Im
just
not
the
social
type
and
campus
life
is
crazy
Understand
I
could
get
money
with
my
eyes
closed
Lost
some
of
my
hottest
verses
down
in
Cabo
So
If
you
find
a
blackberry
with
the
side
scroll
Sell
that
motherfucker
to
any
rapper
that
I
know
Cause
they
need
it
much
more
than
I
ever
will
I
got
new
shit
Im
getting
better
still
Little
niggaz
put
my
name
in
they
verses
Cause
they
girlfriend
put
my
ass
on
a
pedestal
Future
said
cause
its
Ye

kill
And
I
think

that
making
of
a
legend
feel
Problem

other
niggaz

real
Yea

I

lyrics
Hands

Im
too
proud
for

But
with
eyes
shut
Its
you
Im
thinking
of
But
how
we
move
from
A
to
B
it
cant
be
up
to
me
cause
you
dont
know
Who
I
was
before
you
Basically
to
see
a
change
in
me
Id
be
losing
so
I
just
ignore
you
yeah
Oh
oho
But
your
on
my
mind
my
mind
my
mind
my
mind
my
mind
Oh
oho
But
maybe
in
time
in
time
in
time
Ill
tell
you
A
little
bit
a
little
bit
A
little
bit
in
love
with
you
I
guess
that
Im
a
little
bit
a
little
bit
a
little
bit
in
love
with
you
Oh
oho
I
know
you
told
me
break
their
hearts
But
its
you
I
wanna
take
apart
And
I
will
never
ever
be
the
first
to
say
it
But
still
I
they
know
I
ah
ah
ah
I
would
do
it
Push
a
button
Pull
a
trigger
Climb
a
mountain
Jump
off
a
cliff
cause
you
know
baby
I
love
you
love
you
A
little
bit
You
would
do
it
You
would
say
it
Youd
mean
it
I
would
let
you
do
it
It
was
you
and
I
and
I
only
Ha
hm
I
think
Im
a
little
bit
Little
bit
A
little
bit
in
love
with
you
But
only
if
youre
a
little
bit
Little
bit
Little
bit
In
lololololove
with
me
I
hope
they
never
find
out
What
they
already
know
know
know
As
soon
as
its
official
Well
have
to
let
it
go
go
go
So
we
dont
confirm
the
fling
Keep
avoiding
all
the
questions
You
could
teach
me
many
things
Im
just
scared
to
learn
a
lesson
The
pressures
on
Both
hearts
beat
like
a
metronome
Both
nsync
like
a
Justin
song
Feels
so
right
but
its
just
so
wrong
I
wonder
where
my
whereabouts
Where
niggas
that
I
know
tryna
talk
my
girl
out
And
her
friends
say
I
aint
the
one
to
go
for
She
just
get
jealous
cause
you
always
get
approached
more
Oh
well
tell
her
fall
back
caught
up
in
some
more
shit
tell
her
call
back
Tell
her
get
a
man
that
aint
cheating
on
her
ass
With
a
girl
that
I
know
yeah
tell
her
all
that
that
And
as
for
you
I
think
I
know
youre
the
one
The
closest
Ive
come
Im
probably
A
little
bit
A
little
bit
A
little
bit
in
love
with
you
I
guess
that
Im
a
little
bit
A
little
bit
A
little
bit
A
little
bit
in
love
with
you
Oh
oho
Lololololove
with
me
Oh
oho
oh
oho

My
name
is
drizzy
And
I
aint
perfect
And
I
work
hard
So
I
deserve
it
And
I
belong
Right
where
you
see
me
Aint
on
the
fence
about
it
I
aint
mister
fenny
I
got
a
decent
set
of
manners
And
a
job
that
fills
up
any
empty
schedule
or
planner
And
I
fall
in
love
with
girls
Caught
up
in
superficial
glammer
Who
dress
like
Sara
Jessica
And
live
like
princess
Diana
So
often
they
have
addiction
And
Im
the
one
that
will
feed
it
But
truly
you
bad
enough
Where
you
dont
really
even
need
it
You
could
show
up
to
the
party
On
dirty
public
transit
And
I
guarantee
the
camera
man
will
still
be
snapping
candids
Of
you
and
your
possie
partying
Drinking
what
you
get
handed
With
your
virgin
island
tans
All
looking
like
you
just
landed
I
dont
really
understand
it
Im
not
sure
Im
comprehending
But
these
girls
are
having
fun
with
whoevers
money
they
spending
screaming
My
name
is
whezzy
Im
almost
perfect
And
I
work
harder
than
hard
working
Bizarre
circus
Thats
what
my
bars
surface
Therefore
I
act
a
clown
Even
when
I
laying
on
my
back
Im
never
backing
down
So
over
stand
me
I
got
a
condo
in
Miami
And
my
door
mat
is
always
sandy
And
I
run
Louisiana
But
I
never
pulled
a
hami
And
I
got
a
condo
in
Atlanta
And
I
always
wear
a
bandanna
And
when
it
come
down
to
stunning
You
boys
are
just
bunting
And
I
swagging
for
the
fence
Your
girl
hanging
from
my
dick
Your
girl
singing
to
my
shit
like
A
lo
lo
lollipop
She
say
I
get
that
pussy
wetter
than
a
designer
shop
And
she
say
I
pick
that
pussy
better
than
her
gynecologist
Hold
this
Text

whenever
you
want
some
more
dick
More
dick
Old

Young

But
I

damn
All
I
got
is
one
dick

You

on
my
mind
yeah
There
is
nothing
I
could
do
to
fix
it
All
you
ever
asked
me
for
was
time
whoa
When
the
lights
dont
glow
the
same
way
that
they
used
to
And
I
finally
get
a
moment
to
myself
I
will
realize
you
were
everything
Im
missing
And
you
tell
me
youre
in
love
with
someone
else
So
can
you
do
me
a
favor
if
pull
it
together
make
it
sooner
than
later
We
wont
be
here
forever
and
I
realized
I
waited
too
long
but
please
dont
move
on
You
just
changed
your
hair
and
it
looks
perfect
Wish
I
was
the
first
to
let
you
know
every
chance
I
get
to
make
it
better
I
just
find
a
way
to
let
it
go
When
the
lights
dont
glow
the
same
way
that
they
used
to
And
I
finally
get
a
moment
to
myself
I
will
realize
you
were
everything
Im
missing
And
you
tell
me
youre
in
love
with
someone
else
So
can
you
do
me
a
favor
if
pull
it
together
make
it
sooner
than
later
We
wont
be
here
forever
and
I
realized
I
waited
to
long
but
please
dont
move
on
The
girl
or
the
world
you
see
someone
gotta
lose
I
thought
that
I
can
have
it
all
Do
I
really
got
to
choose
What
good
in
all
the
cash
if
it
doesnt
buy
time
And
what
good
in
being
famous
if
Im
never
on
your
mind
Nights
fallen
lights
glowing
and
Im
just
trying
to
pay
the
price
owing
And
I
dont
want
to
feel
the
comfort
of
my
ice
showing
And
Im
not
tryna
be
without
you
at
the
right
moment
nigga
nice
going
Is
it
worth
it
that
decision
because
hearts
breaking
and
I
aint
tryna
be
in
that
collision
So
Im
a
dust
my
shirt
and
fix
my
pants
cause
I
better
look
good
girl
if
this
my
chance
I
swear
So
can
you
do
me
a
favor
if
pull
it
together
make
it
sooner
than
later
We
wont
be
here
forever
and
I
realized
I
waited
to
long
but
please
dont
move
on

lyrics
Uh
Im
just
so
far
gone
octobers
own
Please
leave
me
alone
Drunk
off
champagne
screamin
in
the
phone
See
my
house
is
not
a
home
fuck
is
goin
on
Where
did
we
go
wrong
where
do
we
belong
Caught
up
in
the
game
and
its
one
I
cant
postpone
Meaning
if
it
rains
Im
the
one
its
raining
on
When
my
diamond
chain
is
on
still
nothing
set
in
stone
Women
borrow
sweaters
that
I
spray
with
my
cologne
And
tell
me
dont
forget
em
and
I
promise
that
I
wont
Feelin
so
distant
from
everyone
Ive
known
To
make
everybody
happy
I
think
I
would
need
a
clone
Places
we
get
flown
parties
that
weve
thrown
Ive
done
more
for
this
city
then
these
rappers
that
have
blown
Its
only
been
3
Years
look
at
how
Ive
grown
Im
just
in
my
zone
I
call
this
shit
the
calm
Yea
but
Im
the
furthest
thing
from
calm
Dedicated
to
my
mom
and
I
swear
my
word
is
bond
Everything
will
be
ok
and
it
wont
even
take
that
long
You
can
see
it
in
my
face
or
even
read
it
on
my
palm
Leader
of
the
new
school
its
proven
and
its
known
Im
sittin
in
a
chair
but
in
the
future
its
a
throne
I
know
you
like
to
worry
itll
be
better
if
you
dont
cause
You
know
everything
gone
be
alright
I
promise
A
Pologize
to
you
know
to
put
yall
in
this
position
and
vent
to
yall
but
You
know
so
forgive
me
Uh
And
life
is
so
insane
look
what
Ive
became
tryna
make
a
name
All
my
first
dates
are
interrupted
by
my
fame
Because
every
picture
taken
is
a
fan
that
you
can
gain
They
love
it
when
you
smile
unaware
that
its
a
strain
Its
a
curse
you
gotta
live
with
when
you
born
to
entertain
Women
need
attention
therefore
women
will
complain
Develop
hatred
for
men
and
say
that
your
the
one
to
blame
Tryna
enjoy
myself
with
Taz
in
miami
at
the
game
I
just
wish
he
knew
how
much
it
really
weighed
like
dwayne
Its
a
weight
thats
on
my
chest
whoever
spottin
me
is
playin
So
Im
liftin
all
alone
try
not
to
get
a
sprain
Hopin
western
union
doing
currency
exchange
Cause
my
dad
called
and
got
me
feelin
guilty
and
ashamed
Like
how
I
had
a
Rolls
and
I
went
and
got
a
Range
And
he
payin
for
his
cigarettes
with
dollars
and
some
change
Damn
and
I
could
only
feel
his
pain
Cause
in
memphis
tennessee
theres
only
so
much
to
attain
So
Im
fillin
out
the
form
at
the
counter
once
again
He
say
he
love
me
I
just
hope
he
doesnt
say
that
shit
in
vain
Im
why
yo
girl
heart
is
in
a
slang
Call
me
heartbreak
Drake
Im
the
hardest
one
to
tame
As
a
man
Im
just
honest
as
a
artist
Im
a
king
With
my
own
set
of
problems
that
be
sittin
on
my
brain
Yea
And
see
this
is
the
thang
What
they
viewing
as
braggin
is
the
way
that
I
maintain
The
shit
I
write
while
staring
out
the
window
of
a
plane
Is
the
single
handed
reason
I
Remain
Me
Yea
Uh
I
said
I
call
this
shit
the
calm
But
Im
the
furthest
thing
from
calm
I
swear
Im
puttin
on
but
they
always
wanna
ask
what
type
of
act
you
puttin
on
like
Man
Thanks
to
Desiree
for
adding
these
lyrics
lyrics
This
here
is
on
some
truthful
shit
Its
seems
like
everything
I
do
your
use
to
it
And
I
hate
hearing
stories
bout
who
youve
been
with
Thats
when
I
gotta
hide
what
Im
feeling
inside
So
you
still
think
I
am
confident
and
damn
Is
this
gonna
last
Your
up
on
a
pedastool
Are
we
moving
too
fast
Feels
Like
Im
in
crazy
competition
with
the
past
Thats
why
I
gotta
ask
Is
anything
Im
doin
Brand
New
Is
anything
Im
doin
Brand
New
Girl
Aye
Aye
Aye
This
here
is
something
personal
I
highly
doubt
this
feeling
is
reversible
Knowledge
is
pain
and
that
is
why
it
hurts
to
know
That
you
atempt
to
hide
and
put
mistakes
aside
So
I
dont
ever
question
you
and
damn
I
cant
even
find
the
perfect
brush
So
i
can
paint
whats
going
through
my
mind
Racing
against
myself
but
Im
a
couple
steps
behind
Thats
why
I
gotta
ask
Is
anything
Im
doing
Brand
New
Is
everything
Im
doing
to
late
Did
he
take
your
clothes
off
just
like
this
Did
he
give
you
loving
just
this
Did
you
spend
the
night
in
his
bed
on
the
very
1st
date
Tell
me
baby
Am
I
too
late
Thanks

Throw

Until

To

To

Just

Too
much

kill
ya
And
when
I
leave
I
always
come
right
back
here
The
young
spitter
that
everybody
in
rap
fear
A
lot
of
you
all
still
sounding
like
last
year
The
game
needs
change
and
Im
the
motherfucking
cashier
Nickels
for
my
thoughts
Dimes
in
my
bed
Quarters
of
the
kush
Shape

vivid
picture

HD
Yeah
I
want
it

Thats
why
I
strive
for
it
Diss

Any
awards

or
party
Ill

for
it
I
know
whats
coming
I
just
hope
Im
alive
for
it
I

Yeah
I
want
things
to
go
my
way
But
as
of
late
a
lot
of
shit
been
going
sideways
And
my
mother
tried
to
runaway
from
home
But
I
left
somethin
in
the
car
so
I
caught
her
in
the
driveway
And
she
cried
to
me
so
I
cried
too
And
my
stomach
was
soaking
wet
She
only
52
And
48
hours
all
before
I
showed
up
And
brought
a
thousand
dollars
worth
of
drinks
and
got
poured
up
Damn
my
reality
just
set
in
And
even
when
the
phantoms
leased
them
hoes
wanna
get
in
I
do
a
lot
of
things
Hoping
I
never
have
to
fit
in
So
trying
to
keep
up
with
my
progress
is
like
a
dead
end
My
girl
love
me
but
fuck
it
my
heart
beat
slow
And
right
now
the
tour
bus
is
lookin
like
a
freak
show
And
life
change
for
us
every
single
week
So
its
good
But
I
know
this
aint
the
peak
though
Cause
I
want
I
want
the
money
Money
and
the
cars
Cars
and
the
clothes
The
hoes
I
suppose
I
just
wanna
be
I
just
wanna
be
Successful
I
just
wanna
be
I
just
wanna
be
Successful
I
just
wanna
be
I
just
wanna
be
Successful
Wise
words
from
a
decent
man
Back
when
I
was
trying
to
put
a
ring
on
Alicia
hand
This
lost
boy
got
fly
without
peter
pan
And
my
delivery
just
got
me
buzzing
like
the
pizza
man
In
person
I
am
everything
and
more
Im
everywhere
these
other
niggas
never
been
before
But
inside
Im
treading
waters
steady
trying
to
swim
ashore
Im
on
a
shoppin
spree
to
get
whatever
is
in
store
Just
call
me
shop
and
bag
drizzy
And
call
me
Mrdamn
he
aint
coping
that
is
he
And
fans
of
these
freshman
is
about
to
get
iffy
While
this
youngin
that
you
doubting
is
about
to
get
busy
Im
a
kill
it
I
promise
this
I
know
you
mad
Ive
always
treated
my
city
like
some
shoulder
pads
To
big
homie
use
a
flash
if
you
must
And
I
swear
I
aint
asking
for
much
All
I
want
is
I
want
the
money
Money
and
the
cars
Cars
and
the
clothes
The
hoes
I
suppose
I
just
wanna
be
I
just
wanna
be
Successful
I
just
wanna
be
I
just
wanna
be
Successful
I
just
wanna
be
I

be
Successful
Its

say
it
to
you
Pardon

swag
But

Long

How

I
cant
Miss

woman
like
I
cant
miss
court
dates
Cheese
But
shes
not
in
this
portrait
Lifes

Im
on
the
other
side
but
it
is
a
short
gate
I
dont
want
the
glow
I
want
the
glow
ray
And
Im
a
fuck
the
world
But
this
is
just
foreplay
Tired

Havent

You

You

Riders

wheels
Find
out
where

Kill

in
the
kitchen
The
feds
trying

but
we
aint
even
trippin
First
off
you
know
what
it
is
if
you
heard

Making
hoes

like
a
bridge
in
a
earth
quake
Never

I
live
in
my
work
place
I
give
you
the
business
so
button
up
your
shirt
straight
Look

You

think
I
planned
it
Im
just
doing
me
and
you
can
never
understand
it
Chicks

hammered
Big
dick
bandit
Money
flowing
like
a
slit
wrist
No
bandage
Blowing
purple
clouds
nigga
Im
so
sky
high
I
aint
cutting
anybody
slices
out
of
my
pie
Out
of
this
world
though
Im
so
scifi
And
I
dont
sit
still
I
keep
it
moving
like
a
driveby
I
just
tell
the
truth
and
so
Im
cool
in
every
hood
spot
Twenty
one
years
and
I
aint
never
met
a
good
cop
Me
and
Wayne
lean
like
Kareem
doing
hook
shots
Cover
me
Im
going
in
to
buck
you
when
the
hook
drops
Hold
up
wait
one
motherfucking
minute
Its
the
El
capitan
I
got
motherfucking
lieutenants
If
I
said
Im
going
in
then
I
motherfucking
meant
it
An
if
I
brought
in
the
club
then
Imma
motherfucking
spend
it
Cost
a
few
hundred
bands
an
Im
motherfucking
in
it
No
need
for
a
room
cause
you
know
Im
fucking
in
it
She
acting
like
she
not
but
she
know
she
fucking
wit
it
You
ever
bust
10
nuts
in
a
two
seater
Im
going
in
Where
should
I
begin
I
dont
even
know
maybe
where
my
blunt
ends
An
Imma
be
a
legend
even
when
my
life
ends
An
Imma
be
a
legend
even
when
this
night
ends
Til
I
do
my
thang
hop
up
out
it
like
biem
Bitch
I
said
Im
in
so
Im
nothing
like
them
lyrics
Uh
Im
just
so
far
gone
octobers
own
Please
leave
me
alone
Drunk
off
champagne
screamin
in
the
phone
See
my
house
is
not
a
home
fuck
is
goin
on
Where
did
we
go
wrong
where
do
we
belong
Caught
up
in
the
game
and
its
one
I
cant
postpone
Meaning
if
it
rains
Im
the
one
its
raining
on
When
my
diamond
chain
is
on
still
nothing
set
in
stone
Women
borrow
sweaters
that
I
spray
with
my
cologne
And
tell
me
dont
forget
em
and
I
promise
that
I
wont
Feelin
so
distant
from
everyone
Ive
known
To
make
everybody
happy
I
think
I
would
need
a
clone
Places
we
get
flown
parties
that
weve
thrown
Ive
done
more
for
this
city
then
these
rappers
that
have
blown
Its
only
been
3
Years
look
at
how
Ive
grown
Im
just
in
my
zone
I
call
this
shit
the
calm
Yea
but
Im
the
furthest
thing
from
calm
Dedicated
to
my
mom
and
I
swear
my
word
is
bond
Everything
will
be
ok
and
it
wont
even
take
that
long
You
can
see
it
in
my
face
or
even
read
it
on
my
palm
Leader
of
the
new
school
its
proven
and
its
known
Im
sittin
in
a
chair
but
in
the
future
its
a
throne
I
know
you
like
to
worry
itll
be
better
if
you
dont
cause
You
know
everything
gone
be
alright
I
promise
A
Pologize
to
you
know
to
put
yall
in
this
position
and
vent
to
yall
but
You
know
so
forgive
me
Uh
And
life
is
so
insane
look
what
Ive
became
tryna
make
a
name
All
my
first
dates
are
interrupted
by
my
fame
Because
every
picture
taken
is
a
fan
that
you
can
gain
They
love
it
when
you
smile
unaware
that
its
a
strain
Its
a
curse
you
gotta
live
with
when
you
born
to
entertain
Women
need
attention
therefore
women
will
complain
Develop
hatred
for
men
and
say
that
your
the
one
to
blame
Tryna
enjoy
myself
with
Taz
in
miami
at
the
game
I
just
wish
he
knew
how
much
it
really
weighed
like
dwayne
Its
a
weight
thats
on
my
chest
whoever
spottin
me
is
playin
So
Im
liftin
all
alone
try
not
to
get
a
sprain
Hopin
western
union
doing
currency
exchange
Cause
my
dad
called
and
got
me
feelin
guilty
and
ashamed
Like
how
I
had
a
Rolls
and
I
went
and
got
a
Range
And
he
payin
for
his
cigarettes
with
dollars
and
some
change
Damn
and
I
could
only
feel
his
pain
Cause
in
memphis
tennessee
theres
only
so
much
to
attain
So
Im
fillin
out
the
form
at
the
counter
once
again
He
say
he
love
me
I
just
hope
he
doesnt
say
that
shit
in
vain
Im
why
yo
girl
heart
is
in
a
slang
Call
me
heartbreak
Drake
Im
the
hardest
one
to
tame
As
a
man
Im
just
honest
as
a
artist
Im
a
king
With
my
own
set
of
problems
that
be
sittin
on
my
brain
Yea
And
see
this
is
the
thang
What
they
viewing
as
braggin
is
the
way
that
I
maintain
The
shit
I
write
while
staring
out
the
window
of
a
plane
Is
the
single
handed
reason
I
Remain
Me
Yea
Uh
I
said
I
call
this
shit
the
calm
But
Im
the
furthest
thing
from
calm
I
swear
Im
puttin
on
but
they
always
wanna
ask
what
type
of
act
you
puttin
on
like
Man
lyrics
This
is
why
I
do
this
shit
I
think
they
call
this
uhm
venting
Look
Uhh
This
is
me
Still
the
same
They
want
the
hits
I
play
the
game
No
auto
tune
but
you
can
feel
the
pain
It
all
comes
spilling
out
like
I
hit
a
vein
What
up
lil
Braw
What
up
slum
Ville
I
hope
you
know
that
yall
the
reason
I
have
fun
still
The
fans
thinking
that
we
all
signed
for
one
mill
Equal
opportunities
rapping
that
shit
is
unreal
That
aint
how
it
works
That
aint
that
how
it
goes
And
I
be
getting
high
to
balance
out
the
lows
And
I
could
use
a
writer
to
balance
out
my
flows
But
I
never
share
my
thoughts
This
is
all
a
nigga
knows
And
every
time
I
try
it
opens
up
my
eyes
These
verses
are
a
chance
to
remembered
and
reprised
And
I
would
be
performing
just
as
long
as
Im
alive
So
every
word
I
utter
will
be
mine
Dont
believe
the
lies
Look
me
in
my
eyes
Please
dont
be
scared
of
me
Please
dont
be
scared
of
me
I
remember
you
This
feeling
isnt
new
So
please
dont
be
scared
of
me
Please
dont
be
scared
of
me
Oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
uhh
I
never
cried
when
Pac
died
But
I
probably
will
when
Hov
does
And
if
my
tears
hold
value
then
I
would
drop
one
for
every
single
thing
he
showed
us
And
Ill
be
standing
in
a
puddle
I
stay
away
from
niggas
that
could
land
me
in
some
trouble
And
ima
keep
it
honest
Im
so
tired
of
being
subtle
Its
just
me
Forty
O
and
Neek
standing
in
a
huddle
Staring
at
the
members
of
my
team
Who
get
questioned
about
they
profit
from
this
40
million
dollar
scheme
Just
know
that
Im
in
debt
for
you
defending
all
our
dreams
I
hope
you
tell
your
family
this
shit
aint
what
it
seems
But
yall
the
reason
for
a
lot
of
my
devotion
You
know
I
spend
money
because
spending
time
is
hopeless
And
know
I
pop
bottles
cause
I
bottle
my
emotions
At
least
I
put
it
all
in
the
open
Dont
believe
the
lies
Look
me
in
my
eyes
Please
dont
be
scared
of
me
Please
dont
be
scared
of
me
I
remember
you
This
feeling
isnt
new
So
please
dont
be
scared
of
me
Please
dont
be
scared
of
me
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
uhh
Look
Fuck
all
yall
We
ignore
feelings
here
Premature
millionaires
Welcome
to
my
realest
year
Yeah
I
swear
we
making
a
killing
here
I
should
be
on
top
of
the
world
here
just
chilling
here
Uh
But
its
funny
having
fans
Who
find
you
before
anybody
ever
has
the
chance
and
build
you
up
so
you
could
be
the
biggest
in
the
game
And
realize
when
your
there
sometimes
the
shit
dont
feel
the
same
Yeah
And
plus
things
are
just
surreal
at
home
People
think
Ive
changed
just
because
my
appeal
has
grown
And
now
security
follow
me
everywhere
so
I
never
actually
am
alone
I
just
always
feel
alone
I
think
Im
scared
of
what
the
future
holds
I
was
wishing
for
some
things
and
now
am
used
to
those
Every
girl
I
meet
thinks
Im
fucking
groupie
hoes
The
honesty
of
my
music
has
left
me
too
exposed
All
my
old
friends
think
I
got
a
new
crowd
And
people
seem
to
notice
every
time
I
do
smile
I
guess
that
mean
they
come
few
and
far
between
Even
though
am
living
out
what
you
would
call
the
dream
Yeah
And
my
uncle
aint
even
messaging
me
And
him
missing
in
my
life
is
kind
of
messing
with
me
I
hope
this
isnt
one
of
those
forever
things
Its
funny
how
money
can
change
everything
Dont
believe
the
lies
Look
me
in
my
eyes
Please
dont
be
scared
of
me
Please
dont
be
scared
of
me
I
remember
you
This
feeling
isnt
new
So
please
dont
be
scared
of
me
Please
dont
be
scared
of
me
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
uhh
lyrics
Yesterday
when
we
were
getting
high
you
were
invited
You
wouldve
liked
it
II
know
you
all
too
well
I
said
that
we
could
kiss
the
past
goodbye
but
you
werent
excited
theres
no
way
to
fight
it
You
can
stay
but
shawty
here
I
go
Uh
should
I
spend
the
weekend
in
Vegas
Im
living
inside
a
moment
not
taking
pictures
to
save
it
I
mean
how
could
I
forget
My
memories
never
faded
I
cant
relate
to
these
haters
my
enemies
never
made
it
I
am
still
here
with
who
I
started
with
The
game
needed
life
I
put
my
heart
in
it
I
blew
myself
up
Im
on
some
martyr
shit
Carried
the
weight
for
my
city
like
a
cargo
ship
Uh
Im
23
with
a
money
tree
Growing
more
too
I
just
planted
a
hundred
seeds
Its
ironic
cause
my
mother
was
a
flourist
and
thats
how
she
met
my
pops
and
now
my
garden
is
enourmous
Its
happening
Penny
Lane
just
like
you
said
I
avoided
the
Coke
game
and
went
with
Sprite
instead
Uh
huh
thats
word
to
the
millions
that
they
putting
up
Im
trying
to
do
better
than
good
enough
What
am
I
afraid
of
This
is
suppose
to
be
what
dreams
are
made
of
But
people
I
dont
have
the
time
to
hang
with
always
look
at
me
and
say
the
same
shitthey
say
You
promised
me
you
would
never
change
You
promised
me
you
would
never
change
Uh
Am
I
wrong
for
making
light
of
my
situation
Clap
on
When
40
got
some
shit
for
me
to
snap
on
Now
that
Im
on
I
dont
really
want
to
worry
about
getting
back
on
Im
just
trying
to
stay
on
get
my
fucking
buffet
on
I
heard
they
just
moved
my
grandmother
to
a
nursing
home
And
I
be
acting
like
I
dont
know
how
to
work
a
phone
But
hit
redial
you
see
that
I
just
called
some
chick
I
met
at
the
mall
that
I
barley
know
at
all
and
Plus
this
woman
that
I
messed
with
unprotected
Texting
saying
that
she
wish
she
wouldve
kept
it
The
one
that
Im
laying
next
to
just
looked
over
and
read
it
Man
I
couldnt
tell
you
where
the
fuck
my
head
is
Im
holding
on
by
a
thread
its
Like
Im
high
right
now
the
guy
right
now
and
you
can
tell
by
looking
in
my
eyes
right
now
That
nothing
really
comes
as
a
surprise
right
now
cause
we
just
having
the
time
of
our
lives
right
now
What
am
I
afraid
of
This
is
suppose
to
be
what
dreams
are
made
of
But
people
I
dont
have
the
time
to
hang
with
always
look
at
me
and
say
the
same
shitthey
say
You
promised
me
you
would
never
change
You
promised
you
would
never
change
Well
all
right
Uh
I
live
by
some
advices
girl
Lisa
told
me
The
other
day
Lisa
told
that
she
missed
the
old
me
Which
made
me
question
when
I
went
missing
And
when
I
start
treating
my
friends
different
Maybe
it
was
the
fast
paced
switch
up
Or
the
two
guns
in
my
face
during
the
stick
up
Maybe
cause
the
girl
I
thought
I
trusted
was
who
set
the
whole
shit
up
Or
the
fact
I
havent
seen
em
since
they
locked
Big
Rich
up
I
know
At
the
same
time
Im
quick
to
forget
Im
bout
to
roll
me
up
a
blunt
with
my
list
of
regrets
Burn
it
all
burn
it
all
Im
starting
it
fresh
Cause
half
the
time
I
got
it
right
I
probably
guessed
Did
I
just
trade
free
time
for
camera
time
Will
I
blow
all
of
this
money
baby
Hammer
Time
I
just
need
some
closure
Aint
no
turning
back
for
me
Im
in
till

over
Thanks

Rosetta
stone
I

thing
Ive

About

All

red
jacket
with
some
zippers
Super
good
smidoke

package
of
the
Swishers
I

any
quicker
Yall

But

biggest
skeptic

Ill

Everything

kosher
Two
thumbs

But
Ill

my
sweetheart
Ive
always
liked
my
women
book
and
street
smart
long
as
they
got
a
little
class
like
half
days
and
the
confidence
to
overlook
my
past
ways
time
heals
all
and
heels
hurt
to
walk
in
but
they
go
with
the
clutch
that
you
carry
your
lip
gloss
in
and
look
I
really
think
that
nobody
does
it
better
I
love
the
way

put
it
together

Spades

For

in
a
long

I
did
ohhh
I
was
caught
up
in
these
drinks
they
keep
on
making
An
amazing
conversation
With
this
girl
named
Lorraine
who
says
shes
from
LA
And
keeps
makin
me
laugh
and
even
asks
if
she
can
pay
Ohhhhhh
she
could
be
good
for
me
Ohhh
thats
when
you
text
me
Tell
me
that
you
miss
me
I
forget
about
Lorraine
And
the
fact
shes
right
here
with
me
Shes
starin
in
my
face
somethin
had
to
change
Thought
that
all
these
feelings
went
away
Ohhh
I
hate
getting
messages
from
you

the
perfect
shit

Fucks

feelings
went
away
I
hate
getting
messages
from
you
from
you
Especially
when
you
say
you
shouldve
stayed
Fucks

my
whole
day
I

these
feelings
went
away
Ohhh

With

And

like
missin
rubbers
Im

of
distant

This

the
life
that
Im
used
to
Reintroduced
to
people
Ive
been
introduced
to
Did
you
forget
me
Or
are
you
too
scared
to
tell
me
that
you
met

And
fear
that
I
wont
remember
I
wish
you
could
still
accept
me
for

I
miss
Memphis
Tennessee
my
cousins
my
dad
The
simplistic
beauty
that
all

of
bags
Feelin

And

I

live
life

Uh
it

a
certain
type
of
man
to
teach
To
be
far
from
hood
but
to
understand
the
streets
I
never
threw
away
that
paper
with
my
Grammy
speech
Because
I
havent
hit
the
pinnacles
I
plan
to
reach
Yeah

own
it
if
you
want
it
Kisses

the
moment
And
baby
Ill
never
forget
none
of
that
Girl
I
told
you
I
was
coming
back
Would
of
came
back
for
you
I
just
needed
time
To
do
what
I
have
to
do
Caught
in
a
life
I
cant
let
it
go
whether
thats
right
I
will
never
know
Hope
you
forgive
me
never
meant
wrong
Tried
to
be
patient
and
I
waited
to
long
But
I
woulda
came
back
woulda
came
back
Yesterday
when
we
were
gettin
high
You
were
invited
you
wouldve
liked
it
UhuhII
know
you
all
too
well
I
said
that
we
can
kiss
the
past
goodbye
But
you
werent
excited
theres
no
way
to
fight
it
You
could
stay
but
shorty
here
I
go
Termanology
uh
They
call
me
one
thing
but
they
treat
me
like
another
Im
cheatin
but
do
I
love
her
well
more
than
any
other
So
its
personal
to
paint
you
this
type
of
picture
When
your
wife
is
like
your
sister
seems
you
barely
ever
miss
her
But
another
dude
kiss
her
you
lose
it
you
wanna
diss
her
Wanna
hit
her
like
you
hope
no
one
do
to
your
sister
Go
figure
I
aint
got
a
missus
They
say
its
none
of
yo
biz
when
them
boys
call
their
miss
And
the
halls
shatterin
cause
life
is
like
a
battlefield
And
yall
battlin
cause
you
got
you
a
rapper
deal
So
I
guess
you
start
feelin
how
those
rappers
feel
Raw
dog
hope
she
go
and
get
that
mornin
after
pill
But
if
she
get
knocked
up
you
gon
have
to
peel
Or
your
career
gonna
be
pushin
up
daffodils
Take
care
of
yo
kid
go
check
your
mistress
Hit
the
lab
and
record
go
handle
your
business
What
type
of
life
is
this
So
many
different
choices
Too
many
different
opinions
too
many
different
voices
What
am
I
afriad
of
just
to
say
love
I
love
you
baby
but
this
is
what
Im
made
of
And
Ima
be
me
cause
I
cant
be
no
other
So
I
dont
know
if
Aaliyahs
gettin
a
little
brother
But
all
I
know
is
I
already
got
one
baby
mother
And
thats
too
much
trouble
sorry
I
cant
love
you
What
am
I
afraid
of
This
is
supposed
to
be
what
dreams
are
made
of
But
people
I
dont
have
the
time
to
hang
with
Always
look
at
me
and
say
the
same
shit
They
say

you
promised
me
you
would
never
change
Ohh
oh
oh
ohh
oh
oh
ohh
You
promised
me
you
would
never
change
Ohh
oh
oh
ohh
oh
oh
ohh

Uhh
am
I
wrong
for
makin
light
of
my
situation
Clap
on
When
40
got
some
shit
for
me
to
snap
on
Now
that
Im
on
I
dont
really
wanna
worry
bout
gettin
back
on
Im
just
tryin
to
stay
on
get
my
fuckin
buffet
on
I
heard
they
just
moved
my
grandmother
to
a
nursin
home
And
Ill
be
actin
like
I
dont
know
how
to
work
a
phone
But
hit
redial
youll
see
that
I
just
called
Some
chick
I
met
at
the
mall
that
I
barely
know
at
all
And
plus
this
woman
that
I
messed
with
unprotected
Textin
sayin
she
wish
she
woulda
kept
it
The
one
that
Im
layin
next
to
just
looked
over
and
read
it
Man
I
couldnt
tell
you
where
the
fuck
my
head
is
Im
holdin
on
by
a
thread
its
Like
Im
high
right
now
the
guy
right
now
And
you
could
tell
by
lookin
in
my
eyes
right
now
That
nothin
really
comes
as
a
surprise
right
now
Cause
we
just
havin
the
time
of
our
lives
right
now
Well
alright
uhh
I
live
by
some
advices
girl
Lisa
told
me
The
other
day
Lisa
told
me
that
she
miss
the
old
me
Uh
which
made
me
question
when
I
went
missin
And
when
I
start
treatin
my
friends
different
Maybe
it
was
the
fastpaced
switchup
Or
the
two
guns
in
my
face
durin
the
stickup
Maybe
cause
a
girl
I
thought
I
trusted
was
who
set
the
whole
shit
up
Or
the
fact
I
havent
seen
em
since
they
locked
Big
Rich
up
I
know
but
same
time
Im
quick
to
forget
Im
bout
to
roll
me
up
a
blunt
with
my
list
of
regrets
Burn
it
all
burn
it
all
Im
startin
it
fresh
Cause
half
the
time
I
got
it
right
I
probably
guessed
Did
I
just
trade
free
time
for
camera
time
Will
I
blow
all
of
this
money
baby
Hammer
Time
Yeah
I
just
need
some
closure
Aint
no
turnin
back
for
me
Im
in
it
til
its
over
I
feel
good
I
got
some
time
off
Girl
its
been
so
long
That
you
had
fun
cause
Ima
need
a
cab
just
to
get
me
home
And
maybe
you
can
call
in
sick
And
bring
it
to
the
crib
and
get
all
this
dick
I
know
I
know
Im
blunt
but
how
real
is
that
You
want
that
feelin
back
But
you
should
know
I
still
got
it
for
you
I
still
got
it
for
you
I
still
got
it
for
you
I
still
got
it
for
you
I
still
got
it
for
you
I
still
got
it
for
you
And
even
though
we
let
it
go
its
better
that
you
know
I
still
I
feel
good
I
got
some
time
off
Girl

A

parking
spots

Numbers

spare
me
all

Life

to
adjust
How
come
when
I

a
party
you
stare
at
me
in
disgust
If
it
is
just
to
have
fun
you
should
see
that
as
a
plus
Especially
when
I
come
flyin
through
the
door
And
kindly
ignore
the
paparazzi
outside
and
tryin
to
record
Why
has
every
woman
never
dined
her
before
Am
I
the
only
23

Open

Frequent

And

Somebody
somewhere

to
find
somebody

Alisha

voice
in
your
speaker

ear
Thats

cant

That

Girl
I
cant

I
miss
you
You
and
the
music
were
the
only
things
that
Id
commit
to
I
never
cheated
for
the
record
back
when
I
was
with
you
But
you
believed
in
everything
but
me
girl
I
dont
get
you
She
says
I
know
you
changed
I
never
see
you
cause
youre
always
busy
doing
things
I
really
wish
she
had
a
different
way
of
viewing
things
I
think
the
city
that
were
from
just
kinda
ruined
things
Its
such
a
small
place
not
much
to
do
but
talk
and
listen
The
men
are
jealous
and
the
women
all
in
competition
And
all
your
friends
telling
you
stories
that
you
often
misinterpret
I
could
tell
that
you
been
crying
all
night
drinking
all
summer
Prayin
for
your
happiness
hope
that
you
recover
This
is
one
I
know
you
hated
when
you
heard
it
And
its
worse
because
you
know
that
I
deserve
it
Take
a
shot
for
me
oh
oh
oh
oh
Take
a
shot
for
me
oh
oh
oh
oh
Take
a
shot
for
me
A
shot
for
me
oooooo
A
shot
for
me
oooo
May
your
neighbors
respect
you
Trouble
neglect
you
Angels
protect
you
And
heaven
accept
you
Thanks
to
Tom
Barnett
Alex
for
correcting
these
lyrics
lyrics
I
might
be
too
strung
out
on
compliments
Overdosed
on
confidence
Started
not
to
give
a
fuck
and
stopped
fearing
the
consequence
Drinking
every
night
because
we
drink
to
my
accomplishments
Faded
way
too
long
Im
floating
in
and
out
of
consciousness
And
they
sayin
Im
back
Id
agree
with
that
I
just

about
a
hundred
times
Ima
need
it
back
I
wish
that
you
would
come
and
find
me
Just
to
tell
me
that
I
havent
changed
girl
I
needed
that
from
you
Im
getting
money
just
taking
care
of
me
girl
Im
spending
time
just
taking
care
of
me
right
now
Im
getting
money
just
taking
care
of
me
girl
Cuz
youd
be
tired
of
taking
care
of
me
by
now
But
the
good
ones
go
The
good
ones
go
if
you
wait
too
long
But
the
good
ones
go
The
good
ones
go
if
you
wait
too
long
So
you
should
go
You
should
go
before
you
stay
too
long
Dont
you
go
getting
married
dont
you
go
get
engaged
I
know
youre
getting
older
dont
have
no
time
to
waste
I
shouldnt
be
much
longer
but
you
shouldnt
have
to
wait
Cant
lose
you
cant
help
it
Im
so
sorry
Im
so
selfish
Uh
uh
Ive
been
chilling
in
the
city
where
the
moneys
thrown
high
and
the
girls
get
down
In
case
you
starting
to
wonder
why
my
new
shits
sounding
so
Htown
But
when
its
all
done
baby
Im
yours
if
youre
still
around
She
knows
she
knows
she
knows
But
the
good
ones
go
The
good
ones
go
if
you
wait
too
long
But
the
good
ones
go
The
good
ones
go
if
you
wait
too
long
So
you
should
go
When
a
good
thing
goes
bad
its
not
the
end
of
the
world
Its
just
the
end
of
a
world
that
you
had
with
one
girl
And
shes
the
reason
it
happened
but
shes
overreacting
And
its
all
because
she
dont
want
things
to
change
So
cry
if
you
need
to
but
I
cant
stay
to
watch
you
Thats
the
wrong
thing
to
do
Touch
if
you
need
to
but
I
cant
stay
to
hold
you
Thats
the
wrong
thing
to
do
Talk
if
you
need
to
but
I
cant
stay
to
hear
you
Thats
the
wrong
thing
to
do
Cause
youll
say
you
love
me
and
Ill
end
up
lying
And
say
I
love
you
too
But
I
need
someone
different
You

it
Oh

know
it
I
need

different
You

it
oh
ho
you
know
it
Oh

it
Oh

I

Oh
ho
oh
ho
We
live
in
a
generation
of
not
being
in
love
and
not
being
together
But
we
sure
make
it
feel
like
were
together
Cause
were
scared
to
see
each
other
with
somebody
else
So
cry
if
you
need
to
but
I
cant
stay
to
watch
you
Thats
the
wrong
thing
to
do
Touch
if
you
need
to
but
I
cant
stay
to
hold
you
Thats
the
wrong
thing
to
do
Talk
if
you
need
to
but
I
cant
stay
to
hear
you
Thats
the
wrong
thing
to
do
Cause
youll
say
you
love
me
and
Ill
end
up
lying
And
say
I
love
you
too
But
I
need
someone
different
You
know
it
oh
ho
you
know
it
Oh
ho
you
know
it
we
both
know
it
I
need
someone
different
You
know
it
oh
ho
you
know
it
Oh
ho
you
know
it
we
both
know
it
Somethings
been
missing
You
know
it
oh
ho
she
knows
it
Oh
ho
I
know
it
we
all
know
it
I
need
someone
different
Oh

Its
like
09
in
your
basement
and
Im
in
love
with
Nebby
And
I
still
love
her
but
it
fell
through
because
I
wasnt
ready
And
your
back
hurt
and
your
neck
hurt
and
you
smoking
heavy
And
I
sit
next
to
you
and
I
lecture
you
because
those
are
deadly
And
then
you
ash
it
and
we
argue
about
spending
money
on
bullshit
And
you
tell
me
Im
just
like
my
father
my
one
button
you
push
it
And
I
leave
out
and
you
call
me
and
you
tell
me
that
youre
sorry
You
love
me
and
I
love
you
and
your
heart
hurts
mine
does
too
And
its
just
words
and
they
cut
deep
but
its
our
world
its
just
us
two
I
see
painkillers
on
the
kitchen
counter
I
hate
to
see
it
all
hurt
so
bad
But
maybe
I
wouldnt
have
worked
this
hard
If
you
were
healthy
and
it
werent
so
bad
Uh
maybe
I
should
walk
up
the
street
and
try
and
get
a
job
at
the
bank
Cause
leave
it
up
to
me
J
and
Neeks

bank
Then

I

I

2
years

baggage

Its
all
for

to
carry
bags
she

to
carry
I
hate

I
make
it
so
hard
just
to

I
I
get

poppin
dont
I
Ill
end

I
And
by
the
time
I
end
up
stopping
Youll
be
rocking
one
of
the
rings
you
pointed
out
while
shopping
with
a
nigga
dont
lie
Shes
losing
it
right
now
cause
if
I
wasnt
who
I
am
she
wouldve
been
moving
in
by
now
But
instead
were
moving
slow

I
guess
shes
used
to
it
by
now
And
she
gives
me
all
her
trust
and
Im
abusing
it
right
now
But
this
money
coming
in
is
just
confusing
shit
right
now
You
just
told
me
I
aint
shit
and
I
guess
Im
proving
it
right
now
Id
rather
be
with
you
but
you
are
not
around
So
Imma
call
somebody
up
and
see
if
they
be
down
Cause
I
hate
sleeping
alone
I
hate
sleeping
alone
Half
the
time
we
dont
end
up
fucking
I
dont
ask
her
for
nothing
You
leave
me
in
the
morning
I
dont
see
her
for
months
But
I
just
hate
sleeping
alone
I
hate
sleeping
alone
So
shes
here
and
were
both
so
gone
Hotel
to
hotel
girl

I
could
use
your
company
Full
name
and
birthday
I
book
a
flight
you
come
to
me
But
she
dont
want
a
weekend

she
wants
all
of
me
or
none
of
me
If
she
cant
work
with
all
of
me
then
she
say
she
done
with
me
You
say
that
you
over
me
you
always
end
up
under
me
You
know
how
it
goes

dont
be
crazy
dont
play
dumb
with
me
Dont
start
with
yo
shit

I
put
you
back
in
your
place
And
hang
up
yeah
how
dare
you
tell
me
its
tougher
for
you
Like
I
dont
hear
about
the
niggas
you
fucking
with
too
And
whoever
I
be
with
they
got
nothing
on
you
Thats
just
something
to
do
when
theres
nothing
to
do
Yeah
but
shes
losing
it
right
now
She
has
choices
she
should
make
I
think
shes
choosing
it
right
now
One
more
chance
to
make
it
right
I
think
Im
using
it
right
now
You
just
said
I
never
learn
I
guess
Im
proving
it
right
now
Id
rather
be
with
you
but
you
are
not
around
So
Imma
call
somebody
up
and
see
if
they
be
down
Cause
I
hate
sleeping
alone
I
hate
sleeping
alone
Half
the
time
we
dont
end
up
fucking
I
dont
ask
her
for
nothing
You
leave
me
in
the
morning
I
dont
see
her
for
months
But
I
just
hate
sleeping
alone
I
hate
sleeping
alone

I
reached
the

nigga
I
reached
heights
that
Dwight
Howard
couldnt
reach
nigga
Prince
Akeem
they
throw
flowers
at
my
feet
nigga
I
could
go
a
hour
on
this
beat
nigga
Im
just
as
famous
as
my
mentor
But
thats
still
the
boss
dont
get
sent
for
Get
hype
on
tracks
and
jump
in
front
of
a
bullet
you
wasnt
meant
for
Cause
you
dont
really
wanna
hear
me
vent
more
Hot
temper
scary
outcome
Heres
a
reason
for
niggas
thats
hatin
without
one
That
always
let
they
mouth
run
Bench
players
talkin
like
starters
I
hate
it
Started
from
the
bottom
now
we
here
nigga
we
made
it
Yeah
Tom
Ford
Tuscan
Leather
smelling

brick
Degenerates

Rich

that
I
dont

that
Im

Self
explanatory

Sittin
Gucci

UNLV
Young

Young
Money
nothin
you
could
tell
me
Paperwork
takin
too
long
maybe
they
dont
understand
me
Ill
compromise
if
I
have
to
I
gotta
stay
with
the
family
Not
even
talkin
to
Nicki
communication
is
breakin
I
dropped
the
ball
on
some
personal
shit
I
need
to
embrace
it
Im
honest
I
make
mistakes
Id
be
the
second
to
admit
it
Think
thats
why
I
need
her
in
my
life
to
check
me
when
Im
trippin
On
a
mission
tryna
shift
the
culture
Tell
me
who
dissin
I
got
some
things
thatll
hit
the
culprit
Them
strep
throat
flows
them
shits
to
stop
all
of
the
talkin
All
of
the
talkin
got
one
reply
for
all
of
your
comments
Fuck
what
you
think
Im
too
busy
thats
why
you
leave
a
message
Born
a
perfectionist
guess
that
makes
me
a
bit
obsessive
That
shit
I
heard
from
you
lately
really
relieved
some
pressure
Like
aye
B
I
got
your
CD
you
get
an
E
for
effort
I
piece
letters
together
and
get
to
talkin
reckless
I
dont
change
like
credentials
you
know
you
see
the
necklace
My
lifes
a
completed
checklist
Im
tired
of
hearin
bout
who
you
checkin
for
now
Just
give
it
time
well
see
whos
still
around
a
decade
from
now
Thats
real
How
much
time
is
this
nigga
spendin
on
the
intro
Lately
Ive
been
feelin
like
Guy
Pearce
in
Memento
I
just
set
the
bar
niggas
fall
under
it
like
a
limbo
The
family
all
that

Im
just
out
here
with
my
kinfolk
Off
everything
my
pen
wrote
we
went
from
Bundy
to
Winslow
This
for
shorty
up
on
Glengrove
who
love
when
I
catch
my
tempo
I
sip
the
Pora
and
listen
to
Cappadonna
The
Fresh
Prince
just
had
dinner
with
Tatiana
no
lie
All
these
90s
fantasies
on
my
mind
The
difference
is
that
with
mine
they
all
come
true
in
due
time
I
might
come
through
without
security
to
check
if
youre
fine
Thats
just
me
on
my
solo
like
fuck
it
like
YOLO
You
dont
have
to
prove
shit
to
no
one
except
yourself
And
if
you
end
up
needing
some
extra
help
then
I
can
help
You
know
back
on
your
feet
and
shit
Tryna
get
my
karma
up
fuck
the
guilty
and
greedy
shit
How
much
time
is
this
nigga
spendin
on
the
intro
How
this
nigga
workin
like
he
got
a
fuckin
twin
though
Life
is
soundin
crazy
40
on
Martin
Scorcese
And
I
wouldnt
change
a
thing
if
you
payed
me
now
real

Somewhere
between
psychotic
and
iconic
Somewhere
between
I
want
it
and
I
got
it
Somewhere
between
Im
sober
and
Im
lifted
Somewhere
between
a
mistress
and
commitment
But
I
stay
down
girl
I
always
stay
down
Get
down
have
her
lay
down
Promise
to
break
everybody
off
before
I
break
down
Everyone
just
wait
now
So
much
on
my
plate
now
People
I
believed
in
they
dont
even
show
their
face
now
What
they
got
to
say
now
Nothing
they
can
say
now
Nothing
really
changed
but
still
they
look
at
me
away
now
What
more
can
I
say
now
What
more
can
I
say
now
You
might
feel
like
nothing
was
the
same
I
still
been
drinking
on
the
low
Mobbin
on
the
low
Fuckin
on
the
low
Smokin
on
the
low
I
still
been
plotting
on
the
low
Scheming
on
the
low
The
furthest
thing
from
perfect
Like
everyone
I
know
And
I
hate
that
you
dont
think
I
belong
to
you
Just
too
busy
running
shit
to
run
home
to
you
You
know
that
paper
my
passion
Bittersweet
celebrations
I
know
I
cant
change
what
happened
I
cant
help
it
I
cant
help
it
I
was
young
and
I
was
selfish
I
made
every
woman
feel
like
she
was
mine
and
no
one
elses
Now
you
hate
me
Stop
pretending
stop
that
fronting
I
cant
take
it
Girl
dont
treat
me
like
a
stranger
Girl
you
know
I
seen
you
naked
Girl
you
know
that
I
remember
dont
be
a
pretender
Getting
high
at
the
condo
thats
when
it
all
comes
together
You
know
I
stay
reminiscing
And
makeup
sex
is
tradition
But
youve
been
missing
girl
And
you
might
feel
like
nothing
was
the
same
Drinking
smoking
fucking
plotting
Scheming
plotting
scheming
getting
money
Drinking
fucking
smoking
plotting
scheming
Plotting
scheming
getting
money
Oh

this
shit

We
used
to
be
friends
girl
and
even
back
then
You
would
look
at
me
with
no
hesitation
and
youd
tell
me
baby
its
yours
Nobody
elses
yeah
this
shit
belong
to
nobody
its
yours
Nobody
elses
yeah
this
shit
belong
to
nobody
in
that
Well
made
me
think
about
the
game
girl
And
how
I
switched
it
up
with
a
new
thang
Young
nigga
came
through
on
his
WuTang
And
nowadays
when
I
ask
about
who
got
it
they
say
its
yours
Nobody
elses
yeah
this
shit
belong
to
nobody
its
yours
Nobody
elses
yeah
this
shit
belong
to
nobody
its
yours
How
you
feel
about
coming
home
with
a
nigga
for
the
night
If
you
nervous
hit
the
lights
I
know
we
only
fucking
out
of
spite
Cause
your
man
dont
do
you
right
do
you
right
I
could
fuck
you
so
good
then
I
hit
you
with
the
9am
in
Dallas
who
you
like
Baby
who
you
like
Machine
gun
raps
for
all
my
niggas
in
the
back
Stadium
packed
just
glad
to
see
the
city
on
the
map
I
just
gave
the
city
life
it
aint
about
who
did
it
first
Open
cases
on
me
for
a
half
a
million
each
I
find
peace
knowing
that
its
harder
in
the
streets
I
know
luckily
I
didnt
have
to
grow
there
I
would
only
go
there
cause
theres
niggas
that
I
know
there
I
dont
know
whats
getting
into
me
I
just
like
the
rush
when
you
see
your
enemy
somewhere
in
the
club
And
you
realize
he
just
not
in
a
position
to
reciprocate
your
energy
You
aint
ever
worried
cause
hes
not
who
he
pretends
to
be
People
like
Mazin
who
was
a
best
friend
to
me
Start
to
become
a
distant
memory
Things
change
in
that
life
and
this
life
started
lacking
synergy
And
fucking
with
me
mentally
I
think
its
meant
to
be
Paranoid
always
rolling
with
my
mothafuckin
boys
But
you
gotta
understand
when
its
yours
They
dont
really
leave
your
ass
with
a
mothafuckin
choice
I
just
love
when
Im
with
you
yeah
this
shit
is
on

We
used
to
be

and
even

You

lyrics
Whats
up
Been
a
minute
since
we
kicked
it
Youve
been
caught
up
with
them
bitches
I
dont
get
it
youre
a
star
love
You
shouldnt
have
to
deal
with
that
Id
never
make
you
feel
like
that
Cause
I
love
me
I
love
me
enough
for
the
both
of
us
Thats
why
you
trust
me
I
know
you
been
through
more
than
most
of
us
So
what
are
you
what
are
you
what
are
you
so
afraid
of
Darling
you
you
give
but
you
cannot
take
love
I
needed
to
hear
that
shit
I
hate
when
youre
submissive
Passive
aggressive
when
were
texting
I
feel
the
distance
I
look
around
the
peers
that
surround
me
these
niggas
tripping
I
like
when
money
makes
a
difference
but
dont
make
you
different
Started
realizing
a
couple
places
I
could
take
it
I
want
to
get
back
to
when
I
was
that
kid
in
the
basement
I
want
to
take
it
deeper
than
money
pussy
vacation
And
influence
a
generation
thats
lacking
in
patience
Ive
been
dealing
with
my
dad
speaking
of
lack
of
patience
Just
me
and
my
old
man
getting
back
to
basics
Weve
been
talking
bout
the
future
and
time
that
we
wasted
When
he
put
that
bottle
down
girl
that
niggas
amazing
Well
fuck
it
we
had
a
couple
Coronas
We
might
have
rolled
a
white
paper
just
something
to
hold
us
We
even
talked
about
you
and
our
couple
of
moments
He
said
we
should
hash
it
out
like
a
couple
of
grown
ups
You
a
flower
child
beautiful
child
Im
in
your
zone
Looking
like
you
came
from
the
70s
on
your
own
My
mother
is
66
and
her
favorite
line
to
hit
me
with
is
Who
the
fuck
wants
to
be
70
and
alone
You
dont
even
know
what
you
want
from
love
anymore
I
search
for
something
Im
missing
and
disappear
when
Im
bored
But
girl
what
qualities
was
I
looking
for
before
Who
you
settling
for
Who
better
for
you
than
the
boy
huh
I
love
me
I
love
me
enough
for
the
both
of
us
Thats
why
you
trust
me
I
know
you
been
through
more
than
most
of
us
So
what
are
you
what
are
you
what
are
you
so
afraid
of
Darling
you
you
give
but
you
cannot
take
love
Thinkin
bout
Texas
back
when
Porscha
used
to
work
at
Treasures
Or
further
back
than
that
before
I
had
the
Houston
leverage
When
I
got
Summer
a
Michael
Kors
with
my
mommas
debit
A
weak
attempt
at
flexing
Ill
never
forget
it
Cause
that
night
I
played
her
three
songs
Then
we
got
to
talking
bout
something
we
disagreed
on
Then
she
started
telling
me
how
Ill
never
be
as
big
as
Trey
Songz
Boy
was
she
wrong
that
was
just
negative
energy
for
me
to
feed
off
Now
its
therapeutic
blowing
money
in
The
Galleria
Or
Beverly
Center
Macys
where
I
discovered
Bria
Landmarks
of
the
muses
that
inspired
the
music
When
I
could
tell
it
was
sincere
without
trying
to
prove
it
The
one
that
I
needed
was
Courtney
from
Hooters
on
Peachtree
Ive
always
been
feeling
like
she
was
the
piece
to
complete
me
Now
she
engaged
to
be
married
whats
the
rush
on
commitment
Know
we
were
going
through
some
shit
name
a
couple
that
isnt
Remember
our
talk
in
the
parking
lot
at
the
Ritz
Girl
I
felt
like
we
had
it
all
planned
out
I
guess
I
fucked
up
the
vision
Learning
the
true
consequences
of
my
selfish
decisions
When
you
find
out
how
Im
living
I
just
hope
Im
forgiven
It
seem
like
you
dont
want
this
love
anymore
Im
acting
out
in
the
open
its
hard
for
you
to
ignore
But
girl
what
qualities
was
I
looking
for
before
Who
you
settling
for
who
better
for
you
than
the
boy
huh
I
love
me
I
love
me
enough
for
the
both
of

Dont

too
much
too
much

Theres

Dont

This

a
new
lust
for
you
Done

Last

was
on
the
outro
Stuck
in
the
house
need
to
get
out
mo
Ive
been
stackin
up
like
Im
fundraisin
Most
people
in
my
position
get
complacent
Wanna
come
places
with
star
girls
and
then
end
up
on
them
front
pages
Im
quiet
with
it
I
just
ride
with
it
Moment
I
stop
havin
fun
with
it
Ill
be
done
with
it
Im
the
only
one
thats
puttin
shots
up
And
like
a
potluck
you
need
to
come
with
it
Dont
run
from
it
like
HTown
in
the
summer
time
I
keep
it
100
Met
a
lot
of
girls
in
my
times
there
word
to
Paul
Wall
not
one
fronted
I
was
birthed
there
in
my
first
year
man
I
know
that
place
like
I
come
from
it
Backstage
at
Warehouse
in
09
like
Is
Bun
comin
Fuck
that
is
anyone
comin
before
I
show
up
there
and
theres
no
one
there
These
days
I
could
probably
pack
it
for
like
twenty
nights
if
I
go
in
there
Back
rub
from
my
main
thing
Ive
been
stressed
out
Talkin
to
her
like
back
then
they
didnt
want
me
Im
blessed
now
Talkin
to
her
like
this
drop
bet
a
million
copies
get
pressed
out
Dont
think
about
it
too
much
too
much
too
much
too
much
Theres
no
need
for
us
to
rush
it
through
Dont
think
about
it
too
much
too
much
too
much
too
much
This
is
more
than
just
a
new
lust
for
you
Uh

Someone
go
tell
Noel
to
get
the
Backwoods
Money
got
my
whole
family
goin
backwards
No
dinners
no
holidays
no
nothin
Theres
issues
at
hand
that
were
not
discussin
I
did
not
sign
up
for
this
My
uncle
used
to
have
all
these
things
on
his
bucket
list
Nah
fuck
that
shit
Listen
man
you
can
still
do
what
you
wanna
do
you
gotta
trust
that
shit
Heard
once
that
in
dire
times
when
you
need
a
sign
thats
when
they
appear
Guess
since
my
text
message
didnt
resonate
Ill
just
say
it
here
I
hate
the
fact
my
mom
cooped
up
in
her
apartment
tellin
herself
That
shes
too
sick
to
get
dressed
up
and
go
do
shit
like
thats
true
shit
And
all
my
family
from
the
MTown
that
Ive
been
round
now
Like
we
dont
know
each
other
we
aint
grow
together
we
just
friends
now
Shit
got
me
feelin
pinned
down
pick
the
pen
up
and
put
the
pen
down
Im
writin
to
you
from
a
distance
like
a
pen
pal
but
weve
been
down
Dont
think
about
it
too
much
too
much
too
much
too
much
Theres
no
need
for
us
to
rush
it
through
Dont
think
about
it
too
much
too
much
too
much
too
much
This
is
more
than
just
a
new
lust
for
you
Dont

Theres

This
is
more
than

for
you
Dont
feel
like
you
give
up
Your
hearts
done
Your
loves

We
had
the
type
of
nights
where
morning
comes
too
soon
and
nothing
was
the
same
Watch
me
going
out
of
the
way
When
I
shouldve
went
home
Only
time
of
the
day
I
get
to
spend
on
my
own
I
was
trippin
off
how
I
used
to
sleep
at
ya
crib
Should
drive
by
right
where
you
live
and
pick
you
up
on
the
way
We
aint
spoke
in
so
long
probably
put
me
in
the
past
I
can
still
get
you
wet
and
I
can
still
make
you
laugh
You
should
call
into
work
if
that
aint
too
much
to
ask
I
could
pour
you
up
a
drink
and
we
can
burn
something
Come

Last

Daddy

Like

motherfucking
drivethrough
That

man
Now

niggas

enough
to
do
whatever
I
do
lyrics
Its
not
me
and
you
Its
not
me
Its
you
Youre
reckless
and
you
know
it
They
dont
love
you
like
I
do
Say
youre
moving
on
well
I
guess
thats
just
the
motion
I
dont
have
a
fuck
to
give
I
been
moving
state
to
state
In
my
leather
and
my
Tims
Like
its
1998
And
my
dog
Chubby
Chubb
Thats
my
nigga
from
the
way
On
the
East
side
of
the
city
Thats
where
everybody
stay
Seem
like
everybody
calling
Cause
they
want
me
on
their
song
Its
like
every
time
I
touch
it
I
can
never
do
no
wrong
When
they
need
a
favor
from
ya
man
they
dont
leave
you
alone
But
I
guess
thats
just
the
motion
And
their
phone
doesnt
ring
when
they
got
everything
Thats
the
motion

Yeah
Looking
back
on
it
at
least
my
pride
is
in
tact
Cause
we
said
no
strings
attached
And
I
still
got
tied
up
in
that
Every
thing
that
I
write
is
either
for
her
or
about
her
So
Im
with
her
even
when
Im
here
without
her
And
she
know
it
The
girl
that
I
want
to
save
is
like
a
danger
to
my
health
Try
being
with
somebody
that
want
to
be
somebody
else
I
always
thought
she
was
perfect
when
she
was
being
herself
Dont
even
know
how
to
help
But
I
guess
thats
just
the
motion
Yeah
shell
probably
come
around
soon
as
I
settle
down
Thats
the
motion

Nothing
less
and
nothing
more
I
hear
your
heart
hit
the
floor
I
guess
thats
just
the
motion
Talking
to
yous
not
enough
no
ohh
I
guess
thats
just
the
motion

Having
conversations
with
mama

my
life

a
mess
Aint
been
returning
the
texts
so
she
been
reading
the
press
She
got
google
alerts
them
shits
go
straight
to
her
phone
She
worry
bout
me
from
home
you
know
she
raised
me
alone
At
least
I
always
at
least
I
always
see
it
through
At
least
Im
always
being
true
to
what
you
taught
me
Retired
teacher
but
your
words
still
got
me
evolving
Never
get
sloppy
drunk
but
alcohol
is
problem
solving
And
look
I
hate
it
when
you
hate
on
all
my
girlfriends
And
assistants
always
convinced
that
theres
always
someone
better
Like
that
girl
from
that
gym
who
trains
you
I
know
you
wanna
arrange
it
you
told
me
shes
free
thursday
And
Im
sure
that
shes
a
angel
but
she
dont
want
this
life
The
timing
aint
right
Maybe
one
day
but
even
one
day
with
us
is
a
time
of
a
life
We
do
things
that
people
pay
to
document
You
got
the
sweetest
heart
but
Im
not
here
to
give
out
compliments
or
boost
nobody
confidence
momma
I
got
no
friends
in
this
momma
I
dont
pretend

this
momma
Ion

momma
I

the
knife
out
my
back
and
cut
they
throat
with

I
really
hate
using
this
tone
with
you
momma
I

with
you
momma
I

hate
wasting
your
time
to

momma
I

every
time

a
song
with

What

a
crazy
life
But

the
six
raised
me
right
that
was
great
advice
You

the
six
raised
me
right
that
shit
saved
my
life
Having
conversations
with
momma
we
start
talkin
bout
dad
You
know
he
dropping
a
single
he
saying
this
is
his
window
That
nigga
still
wearing
linen
that
nigga
still
in
the
club
Call
him
after
we
get
off
the
phone
and
show
him
some
love
That
nigga
memphis
for
real
girl
he
love
you
to
death
He
made
mistakes
throughout
his
life
that
he
still
doesnt
accept
But
he
just
want
our
forgiveness
and
fuck
it
look
how
we
living
Im
content
with
this
story
who
are
we
not
to
forgive
him
At
least
I
been
to
a
prison
at
least
I
know
what
its
like
I
used
to
rap
on
the
phone
one
of
his
friends
doing
life
And
now
I
got
me
a
Grammy
that
could
be
part
of
the
reason
Lets
just
call
this
shit
even
we
got
some
things
to
believe
in
Do

Bell
and
Reny
shit
couldve
gone
south

me
ma
He

let
me
do
drugs
He
let
me
shoot
a
gun
one
summer
but
out
there
everyone
does
He
made
me
listen
to
his
music
old
music
soul
music
Shit
that
can
only
be
created
if
you
go
through
it
I
used
to
get
teased
for
being
black
and
now
Im
here
and
Im
not
black
enough
Cause
Im
not
acting
tough
or
making
stories
up
bout
where
Im
actually
from
But
I
just
roll
with
it
momma
rolling
stone
with
it
momma
Gotta
be
careful
around
rolling
stones
or
anyone
thats
tryna
throw
stones
at
me
momma
Im
not
condoning
it
momma
They
will
not
tear
nothing
down
I

this
home
for
you
momma
Know
I
dont
call

momma
I

working
with
so
little
time
for

Hard
labor

price
You

life

Why

Always

your
New
York
condo
Why

If

Why
are
we
wasting
our
relationship
on
a
relationship
Why
are
we
rushing
and
forcing
it
This
isnt
making
sense
Why
are
we
focused
on
things
that
dont
even
mean
nothing
girl
Why
can
we
not
find
the
time
and
sit
down
and
discuss
it
girl

my
side
of

Funny

Just
to
show
the
city
what
it
takes
to
be
alive
for
it
Cant
get
me
on
the
line
so
they
hang
me
out
to
dry
for
it
You
know
40
wants
peace
but
Im
down
to
cut
ties
for
it
And
I
cant
sleep
these
days
unless
I
take
one
If
they
dont
have
a
story
these
days
theyll
make
one
Life
is
always
on
man
I
never
get
a
break
from
it
Doesnt
matter
where
I
go
I
can
never
get
away
from
it
They
give
me
loyalty
and
I
dont
gotta
pay
for
it
Same
way
breads
gotta
break
for
it
Keeping
people
fed
is
my
only
peace
of
mind
now
And
I
turn
the
six
upside
down

a
nine

I

Without

Chasing

You

Dont

Riri

next
to
me
I
hate
a
rapper
especially
They
feel
the
same
but
they
hide
it
They
just
discuss
it
in
private
Dont
get
along
man
we
tried
it
Whats
the
point
in
even
trying
I
hate
a
goofy
especially
They
always
dying
to
mention
me
They
gotta
die
out
eventually
I
could
not
give
you
the
recipe
You

sold
separately
Swear
I
just
had
an
epiphany
It
cost
me
50
at
Tiffanys
Shout

Tiffany
Stephanie
They

to
always
come

for
me
My

with
my
other
enemies
I
dont
let
it
get
to
me
Done
Look
what
Ive
done
in
my
life
I
had
to
count
it
then
count

So
dont
play
with
my
money
this
summer
Im

I
dont

You

You

of
the
story
They

Niggas

They

I

empathy
Imma

Bs

They

legacy
I
dont

After

Aidan

for
correcting
these

lyrics
One
of
them
ones
Right
Weston
Road
Flows
I
did
this
shit
for
my
nigga
Renny
Back
when
we
couldnt
buy
pizza
cause
we
were
down
to
pennies
Feel
like
we
go
back
a
century
runnin
the
store
for
centuries
Then
bring
it
back
to
your
brother
man
we
had
to
respect
it
He
was
wavy
doin
mixtapes
out
of
your
basement
He
let
us
hit
the
weed
on
occasion
for
entertainment
Then
he
would
leave
us
at
the
house
and
go
out
on
a
mission
We
probably
wouldve
got
in
less
trouble
just
goin
with
him
Feel
like
I
never
say
much
but
man
theres
a
lot
to
know
Feel
like
the
difference
between
us
really
startin
to
show
Im
lookin
at
they
first
week
numbers
like
what
are
those
I
mean
you
boys
not
even
coming
close
I
gave
niggas
like
you
a
reason
for
celebration
You
number
one
and
Im
Eddie
Murphy
we
tradin
places
Lookin
in
the
mirror
Im
closer
than
I
really
appear
Creepin
like
Chilli
without
the
tender
love
and
care
No
tender
love
and
care
and
no
love
and
affection
I
got
a
price
on
my
head
but
theres
a
risk
to
collect
it
I
might
be
here
as
a
vessel
to
teach
people
the
lesson
Feel
like
they
wanted
me

but
couldnt
pull
it
together
Yeah
but
here
we
are
and
its
a
new
semester
40
the
only
one
that
know
how
I
deal
with
the
pressure
A
couple
nights
where
it
started
to
feel
like
the
feelings
faded
A
lot
of
problems
that
cant
be
fixed
with
a
conversation
Your
best
day
is
my
worst
day
I
get
green
like
Earth
Day
You
treat
me
like
Im
born
yesterday
you
forgot
my
birthday
You
dont
be
scorin
perfect
you
dont
be
workin
like
how
we
be
workin
You
platinum
like
rappers
on
Hersheys
boy
that
shit
is
worthless
You
get
the
message
over
and
over
like
it
was
urgent
And
then
act
like
you
aint
heard
it
when
you
see
me
in
person
The
only
thing
I
did
to
end
up
here
was
put
the
work
in
And
did
it
with
a
purpose
Used
to
have
secret
handshakes
to
confirm
my
friendships
Nowadays
they
just
shakin
my
hand
to
hide
the
tension
A
lot
of
people
just
hit
me
up
when
my
name
is
mentioned
Shout
out
to
KD

get
the

bachelor
apartment
Leave

a
second
to
get
it
Weston
Road

confidence
level
gettin
settled
Dont

to
backpedal
Dont

Your

I
met
someone

If

And
I
gave
you
all
my
trust
Would
you
comfort
me
And

Life
we

You
have

No

10

Fiftytwo

The

We

Americas
most
wanted

Im

All

No

feelings
but
Ill
still
get
you
spun
Went

got
diplomas
and
we
still
goin
dumb
Please
never
label
niggas
who
lay
down
for
a

My
competition
its
beyond
offensive
Im
in
it
for
the
glory
not
the
honor
mention
Not
tryna
be
fourth
and
inches
Im
tryna
go
the
distance
Yeah
distance
Im
on
a
different
mission
hot
and
fresh
out
the
kitchen
How
you
forget
to
fill
up
with
gas
on
the
road
to
riches
Too
overly
ambitious
too
late
to
fix
it
Too
late
for
condolences
when
its
over
with
I
need
to
start
sayin
shit
when
I
notice
it
Be
open
with
people
I
need
some
closure
with
Be
honest
with
myself
and
take
ownership
Opinions
started
to
burn
when
tables
started
to
turn
I
really
used
to
feel
like
they
loved
a
nigga
at
first
Excitin
times
revitalized
Trust
this
little
light
of
mine
is
gonna
shine
positively
Im
just
takin
what
God
will
give
me
Grateful
like
Jerry
Bob
and
Mickey
Better
attitude
well
see
where
it
gets
me
I
know
catchin
flies
with
honey
is
still
sticky
I
wrote
the
book
on
worldclass
finesses
And
tasteful
gestures
and
makin
efforts
And
never
placin
second
And
even
better
knowin
youre
first
but
then
takin
second
Inspirin
and
never
takin
credit
I
know
I
deserve
more
I
just
never
said
it
Two
middle
fingers
as
I
make
a
exit
yeah
Did
I
lose
you
Did

Did
I
lose
you
Winnin
is
problematic
People
like
you
more
when
you
workin
towards
somethin
Not
when
you
have
it
Way
less
support
from
my
peers
In
recent
years
as
I
get
established
Unforgivin
times
but
fuck
it
I
manage
Why
is
my
struggle
different
than
others
Only
child
thats
takin
care
of
his
mother
As
health
worsens
and
bills
double
Thats
not
respectable
all
of
a
sudden
I
dont
get
a
pat
on
the
back
for
the
come
up
What
do
you
see
when
you
see
me
When
did
all
the
things
I
mean
From
the
bottom
of
my
heart
start
to
lose
meaning
Maybe
I
share
it
with
too
many
people
Back
then
it
used
to
just
feel
like
our
secret
Back
when
I
would
write
And
not
think
about
how
they
receive
it
I
be
tryna
manifest
the
things
I
needed
And
look
now
I
mean
its
hard
to
believe
it
even
for
me
But
youre
mindful
of
it
all
when
your
mind
full
of
it
all
How
they
go
from
not
wantin
me
at
all
To
wantin
to
see
me
lose
it
all
Things
get
dark
but
my
aura
just
starts
glowin
Im
overcome
with
emotions
Ones
I
cant
access
when
Im
stoned
sober
Jealous
ones
still
envy
and
niggas
turn
king
cobra
I
could
only
speak
what
I
know
of
Man
we
wrote
the
book
on
calculated
thinkin
And
icy
Heineken
drinkin
and
rival
neighborhoods
linkin
And
puttin
your
trust
in
someone
With
the
risk
of
financially
sinkin
All
you
did
was
write
the
book
on
garbageass
Rollies
Ego
strokin
picture
postin
Claimin
that
youd
do
it
for
motivational
purposes
only
But
you
just
had
to
show
me
See
I
know
cause
I
study
you
closely
I
know
when
someone
lyin
I
notice
people
standin
for
nothin
and
gettin
tired
I
know
what
were
both
thinkin
even
when
youre
quiet
Sometimes
I
gotta
just
make
sure
that
I
didnt
lose
you
Did

All

Tell
your
big
homie
Im

again
He
aint
even
die
and
I
ball
with
his
inheritance
All
thats
in
my
account
at
the
Bank
of
America
All
that
Drake
hysteria
Six
side
east
side
all
that
for
my
area
You
know
hun
Im
a
bit
concerned
about
this
negative
tone
that
Im
hearing
in
your
voice
these
days
I
can
appreciate
where
your
uncertainly
stems
from
and
you
have
reason
to
question
your
anxieties
and
how
disillusioned
you
feel
as
well
as
feeling
skeptical
about
who
you
believe
you
can
trust
But
that
attitude
will
just
hold
you
back
in
this
life
and
youre
going
to
continue
to
feel
alienated
Give
some
thought
to
this
because
Im
confident
in
you
and
I
know
you
can
reach
your
desired
destination
and
accomplish
your
goals
much
more
quickly
without
this
confrontation
Im
hearing
in
your
tone
these
days
When
others
go
low
we
go
high
Yeah
According
to
my
as
you
beg
I
testified
it
I
been
alone
girl
you
finally
got
me
on
my
own
I
know
and
I
miss
you
Know
how
to
treat
you
but
its
difficult
Thank
God
Im
Christian
Remember
how
this
all
begun
just
us
You
proved
her
right
every
single
night
Oh
my
oh
my
cant
close
my
eyes
Cant
open
my
eyes
dont
know
what
to
do
Im
in
some
kind
of

All
the
things
I

I

Yeah
used
to
be
at
SilverCity
Indigo
Used
to
be
in
lunchroom
playin
dominoes
I
dont
want
to
have
to
go
to
funerals
I
gotta
start
sleepin
at
the
studio
I
dont
have
no
time
to
be
no
Romeo
All
the
love
I

the
rodeo
All
the
love
I
need
is
here
at
OVO
yeah
All
the
girls
I
know
are
there
with
Ian
Throw
Who
knows
where
I
end
up
when
that
shit
gets
old
Maybe
it
never
gets
old
and
thats
just
how
it
goes
Last
table
left
in
Carbone
callin
plays
on
a
rotary
phone
Might
move
our
annual
shit
to
the
Dome
I
need
40
000
people
to
see
what
Im
on
Yeah
ducked
a
lot
of
spiteful
moves
I
was
an
angry
youth
when
I
was
writin
Views
Saw
a
side
of
myself
that
I
just
never
knew
Ill
probably
selfdestruct
if
I
ever
lose
but
I
never
do
Steady
doin
double
shifts
1da
doin
the
beat
and
I
open
up
like
a
double
click
More
blessings
because
Im
generous
Thirtyseater
plane
for
like
ten
of
us
Remember
when
I
bought
Sealey
the
fake
Chanel
wallet
She
knew
that
shit
was
a
fraud
but
never
told
me
about
it
Nowadays
when
we
catchin
up
we
just
laugh
about
it
Cant
describe
what
my
life
is
like
when
she
asks
about
it
Scary
whenever
I
close
my
eyes
at
night
Wakin
up
to
public
statements
about
my
private
life
I
can
never
sleep
til
morning
on
all
my
quiet
nights
But
you
can
rest
assure
that
my
mind
is
right
Get
no
sick
days
I
leave
for
like
three
months
in
six
days
Never
stick
around
to
see
shit
change
Get
lil
updates
texts
in
my
inboxes
have
been
poppin
Seasons
go
by
like
Im
bingewatchin
Went
from
Club
Palazzo
in
the
Bridge
to
Club
LIV
To
not
even
showin
up
to
a
club
less
we
doin
bis
I
cant
even
party
while
a
nigga
pursuin
this
Distractions
will
do
you
in
in
the
truest
sense
Especially
people
that
want
to
lecture
me
and
frame
it
like
they
just
want
the
best
for
me
Or
they
check
for
me
whatever
splits
it
up
So
theres
more
for
them
and
theres
less
for
me
They
dont
know
they
got
to
be
faster
than
me
to
get
to
me
No
ones
done
it
successfully
7AM
in
Germany
cant
believe
that
they
heard
of
me
Last
verse
that
I
gotta
do
is
always
like
surgery
Always
tryin
to
let
go
of
anything
thatll
burden
me
Thats
the
reason
you
can
feel
the
tension
and
the
urgency
Last
chance
I
get
to
make
sure
that
you
take
it
personally
Take
this
shit
to
heart
its
always
executed
perfectly
If
we
do
a
song
its
like
takin
my
kids
to
work
with
me
You
overnight
celebrity
you
one
day
star
Swear
I
Told
You
that
Im
in
this
bitch
for
eternity
I
am
a
reflection
of
all
of
your
insecurities
Behind
closed
doors
a
lot
of
6
God
worshipping
Done
talk
now
cause
theres
other
shit
thats
concernin
me
Theres
real
ones
around
me
I
want
to
make
sure
they
learn
from
me
I
want
to
see
my
dog
but
his
grandmothers
his
surety
He
cant
even
dip
out
to
see
me
in
an
emergency
My
life
is
set
around
competition
and
currency
Takin
summer
off
cause
they
tell
me
I
need
recovery
Maybe
gettin
back
to
my
regular
life
will
humble
me
Ill
be
back
in
2018
to
give
you
the
summary
More

The

She

Imagine

You

you

be
dissin
you
dawg
Damn
okay
from

perspective
I
can
see
what
youre
talkin
bout
no
way
to
soften
it
Cause
me
I
was
tryna
find
out
where
I
lost
em
at
But
maybe
I
aint
lose
em
at
all
Maybe
I
keep
movin
forward
and
they
just
stagnant
They
aint
movin
at
all
But
when
they
need
a
favor
who
do
they
call
Maybe
Im
searchin
for
the
problems
Askin
what
was
said
and
who
was
involved
Too
focused
on
peoples
feedback
and
provin
em
wrong
They
say
the
shoe
can
always
fit
no
matter
whose
foot
its
on
These

squeezin
in
em
Whoever

leave
em
with

I
run
in
the
game
in
these
man
the
seams

splittin
No
pun
intended
but
theyre
smellin
defeat
in
the
air
Headed
where
nobody
took
it
who
meetin
me
there
They
tell
him
that

talkin
crazy
but
he
doesnt
care
Bein

Sex

Baby
I

Buzz
so

I
could
probably
sell
a
blank
disk
When
my
album
drop
Bitches
will
buy
it
for
the
picture
And
niggas
will
buy
it
too
and
claim
they
got
it
for
they
sister
Magazine
paper
girl
But
money
aint
the
issue
They
bring
dinner
to
my
room
and
ask
me
to
initial
She
call
me
the
referee
Cause
I
be
so
official
My
shirt
aint
got
no
stripes
but
I
can
make
yo
pussy
whistle
Like
the
Andy
Griffith
theme
song
And
who
told
you
to
put
them
jeans
on
double
cup
love
You
the
one
I
lean
on
Feeling
for
a
fix
then
you
should
really
get
yo
pheen
on
Yea
just
know
my
condo
is
the
crack
spot
Every
single
show
she
out
there
repping
like
a
mascot
Get
it
from
the
back
And
make
yo
fucking
bra
strap
pop
All
up
in
yo
slot
until
the
nigga
hit
the
jackpots
I
say
you
the
fucking
best
You
the
fucking
best
You
the
fucking
best
You
the
fucking
best
Best
I
ever
had
Best
I
ever
had
Best
I
ever
had
Best
I
ever
had
Best
I
ever
had
lyrics
I
gotta
be
honest
I
think
you
know
Were
covered
in
lies
and
thats
okay
Theres
somewhere
beyond
this
I
know
Yeah
normally
it
aint
a
question
We
would
cross
paths
like
an
intersection
But
she
just
too
far
away
for
affection
So
I
pray
that
we
never
lose
the
connection
Cause
I
remember
Stacy
she
probably
hate
me
She
used
to
threaten
she
had
a
man
to
replace
me
She
talked
that
shit
I
just
hit
the
escape
key
And
then
shed
get
mad
and
want
to
go
and
erase
me
And
I
remember
Amy
she
used
to
AIM
me
She
stayed
up
late
and
used
to
blame
me
She
say
Im
too
wild
she
wanna
tame
me
I
told
her
Even
Photoshop
couldnt
change
me
But
youyouyou
You
got
me
open
girl
why
lie
We
aint
even
tryin
to
settle
so
why
try
End
the
night
with
a
kiss
and
a
byebye
No
strings
attached
your
love
is
so
WiFi
I
gotta
be
honest
I
think
you
know
Were
covered
in
lies
and
thats
okay
Theres
somewhere
beyond
this
I
know
But
I
hope
I
can
find
the
words
to
say
My
freak
girl
tell
me
now
she
a
christian
My
white
girl
wanna
move
back
to
Michigan
Im

Theres
somewhere
beyond

I
know
But
I
hope
I
can
find
the
words
to
say
This
here
is
on
some
truthful
shit
It

around
theyve
been
waking
up
with
I
swear
you
dont
know
this
city
anymore
They
mightve
loved
you
before
But
youre
out
here
doing
your
thing
They
dont
know
you

Sure
they
do
theyre
just
not
as
sincere
Its
crazy
all
the
emotions
forgot
in
a
year
Well
out
there
there
aint
nothing
for
me
and
I
think
I
need
to
come
home
Tell
me
who
did
I
leave
behind
You
think
you
got
to
me
I
can
just
read
your
mind
You
think
Im
so
caught
up
in
where
I
am
right
now
But
believe
I
remember
it
all
I
be
with
my
nigga
chubbs
He
in
love
with
street
shit
No
wonder
why
I
feel
awkward
at
this
fashion
week
shit
No
wonder
why
I
keep
fucking
up
the
double
cheek
kiss
Along
for
that
ignorant
Young
Money
Miami
beach
shit
A
couple
of
artists
got
words
for
me
thats
never
fun
They
say
its
on
when
they
see
me
that
day
dont
ever
come
Im
never
scared
they
never
real
I
never
run
When
all
is
said
and
done
more
is
always
said
than
done
And
I
was
told
once
things
will
change
By
a
nigga
named
tip
when
my
deal
came
Told
me
its
all
good
even
when
it
feels
strange
Now
Im
the
guy
that
know
strippers
by
they
real
names
Rochelle
Jordanne
thick
bitches
they
just
talked
me
out
of
4
grand
How
did
a
pile
of
kush
become
the
mountain
of
truth
How
did
a
bottle
of
wine
become
the
fountain
of
youth
Damn
my
biggest
fear
is
losing
it
all
Remember
how
I
used
to
feel
at
the
start
of
it
And
now
Im
living
a
muthafuckin
fairy
tale
And
still
trying
to
keep
you
feeling
a
part
of
it
Yea
just
lie
to
my
ears
Tell
me
it
feel
the
same
its
all
Ive
been
dying
to
hear
Lights
get
low
and
thats
when
I
have
my
brightest
ideas
And
I
heard
my
city
feel
better
than
ever
Thats
why
I
gotta
come
home
Tell
me
who
did
I
leave
behind
You
think
you
got
to
me
I
can
just
read
your
mind
You
think
Im
so
caught
up
in
where
I
am
right
now
But
believe
I
remember
it
all
My
mother
is
back
to
who
she
was
years
ago
Its
like
a
new
page
me
and
her
are
beginning
on
I
wish
she
stopped
checking
up
on
women
I
cant
stand
Cause
I
got
new
girls
I
could
use
her
opinion
on
She
thinks
Ive
become
a
slave
to
the
wealth
But
Ill
never
break
the
promises
I
made
to
myself
And
I
would
never
make
up
names
for
myself
Then
change
the
names
that
I
just
gave
to
myself
I
used
to
brag
about
it
to
my
friends
and
now
Im
feeling
like
all
of
these
niggas
cutthroat
And
maybe
thats
all
they
do
is
just
pretend
damn
But
I
bought
it
though
I
believed
it
Yea
I
thought
it
and
I
achieved
it
Yea
so
show
me
love
show
me
fucking
love
Cause
I
thought
it
was
all
I
needed
Yea
Clearly
I
was
wrong
about
it
all
along
And
this
will
be
the
year
that
I
wont
even
feel
shit
They
trip
about
the
amount
of
people
I
brought
along
But
Im
just
trying
to
be
surrounded
by
some
real
shit
Need
credentials
for
everyone
of
these
Toronto
kids
I
promise
they
see
it
with
me
we
just
tryna
live
I
told
em
we
bout
to
get
it
and
we
finally
did
Listen
closely
to
my
shit
I
swear
it
sounded
like
home
Tell
me
who
did
I
leave
behind
You
think
you
got
to
me
I
can
just
read
your
mind
You
think
Im
so
caught
up
in
where
I
am
right
now
But
believe
I
remember
it
all
lyrics
Ive
always
wondered
why
you
bothered
putting
make
up
on
You
dont
need
it
Even
tho
I
always
tell
you
that

beautiful
I
repeat
cause
I
dont
want
no
singer
and
I
dont
want
no
model
I
dont
want

fashion
designer
or
nothing
I
just
want
your
love
Telling
you

more
than
enough

something
Missing
and
that
champagne
youve
Been
sipping
not
suppose
to
make
you
Different
all
the
time
Its
starting
to
feel
like
the
wrong
thing
To
do

Cause
with
all
that
recognition
It
gets
hard
for
you
to
listen
to
the
things
That
I
must
say
to
make
you
mine
But
live
girl
have
some
fun
girl
well
be
fine
Trying
to
convince
myself
I
found
one
Making
a
mistake
I
never
learned
from
I
swear
I
always
fall
for
your
type

For
your
type
Tell
me
why
I
always
fall
for
your
type

For
your
type
I
just
cant
explain
this
shit
at
all
I
just
cant
explain
this
shit
at
all
I
just
cant
explain
this
shit
at
all
I
just
cant
explain
this
shit
at
all
Never
believed
in
people
like
you
Cause
who
am
I
to
judge
you
on
the
past
girl
I
bet
theres
a
reason
for
it
all
You
say
that
youre
nothing
like
the
last
girl
I
just
pray
that
you
dont
let
me
down
right
now
But
its
too
late
cause
Im
already
yours
You
just
gotta
promise
me
hearts
wont
break
And
end
up
like
before
Look
Dress
hangin
off
your
shoulder
barely
sober
Telling
me
how
youre
moving
away
and
starting
over
Girl

playin
you
just
drunk
you
just
saying
shit
And
you
dance
dance
like
how
like
ballet
and
shit
Oh
wait
no
I
get
it
girl
Im
wit
it
I
been
down
this
road
before
and
yeah
I
skid
it
But
forget
it
damn
damn
I
wonder
why
I
never
learned
my
lesson
Its
feeling
like
its
second
chance
and
its
the
first
impression
And
I
heard
theres
nothing
new
except
for
someone
new
But
how
you
supposed
to
find
the
one
when
anyone
dont
come
with
you
Talking
to
myself
but
I
never
listen
Cause
man
its
been
a
while
and
I
swear
that
this
ones
different
Thats
why
Ima
take
you
anywhere
you
wanna
go
Let
you
meet
my
friends
so
they
can
lecture
me
again
About
how
reckless
I
have
been
And
Im
slowly
running
out
of
all
the
time
that
I
invested
Making
all
the
same
mistakes
And
Im
just
trying
to
correct
it
and
I
fall
Thanks
to
briasia
for
adding
these
lyrics
lyrics
Take
you
back
Take
you
back
That
was
such
a
lie
Every
time
you
said
you
loved
me
you
cant
look
me
in
my
eyes
And
I
beg
you
for
the
truth
so
much
goin
thru
my
mind
And
my
father
did
just
pass
to
make
my
problems
multiply
And
I
know
nobodys
perfect
but
you
finally
crossed
the
line
And
I
gave
you
everything
but
you
was
never
satisfied
And
you
said
I
was
the
one
just
like
you
told
another
five
Feel
like
its
a
competition
against
all
these
other
guys
Texted
me
the
other
night
its
been
too
long
Always
tryna
figure
out
if
Ima
move
on
Staring
at
the
ceiling
almost
all
night
long
Probably
why
I
had
the
time
to
write
this
song
Texted
me
the
other

its
been

Always
tryna
figure

Ima
move

almost

Probably
why
I
had
the
time
to
write
this
song
Every
time
I
see
you
feels
like
time
is
moving
slow
Its
unfortunate
for
me
I
have
some
trouble
letting
go
Even
though
its
in
the
past
I
just
felt
like
you
should
know
And
you
hate
me
when
I
get
high
but
youre
the
reason
that
I
smoke
Girl
quit
playin
Girl
quit
playin
You
aint
love
me
from
the
start
Youre
the
reason
that
I
feel
this
way
You
broke
my
fuckin
heart
And
I
gave
you
all
my
trust
but
you
just
tore
it
all
apart
Now
youre
all
I
think
about
while
Im
layin
in
the
dark
Texted
me

Been
a
couple
months
and
youre
beggin
for
me
back
And
I
love
all
the
attention
Im
not
sure
how
I
should
act
And
youre
saying
that
you
miss
me
I
refuse
to
say
it
back
Even
though
I
still
do
want
you
I
dont
have
the
time
for
that
Cause
these
women

same
while

lyrics
It
may
not
mean
nothing

So
I
dont

on
stopping
at

I

this
shit

ever

Im
shutting
shit
down
in
the
mall
And

And
I
aint
even
planning
to
call
I
want
this
shit
forever
mine
ever

Last
name
ever
First

Like

to
play
with
Started
off
local
but
thanks
to
all
the
haters
I
know
G4
pilots
on
a
first

basis
In
your
city
faded
off
the
brown
Nino
She
insists
she
got
more
class
we
know
Swimming
in
the
money
come
and
find
me
Nemo
If
I
was
at
the
club
you
know
I
balled
chemo
Drop
the
mix
tape
that
shit
sounded
like
an
album
Whoda
thought
a
country
wide
tourd
be
the
outcome
Labels
want
my
name
beside
the
X
like
Malcolm
Everybody
got
a
deal
I
did
it
without
one
Yeah
nigga
Im
about
my
business
Killing
all
these
rappers
you
would
swear
I
had
a
hit
list
Everyone
who
doubted
me
is
asking
for
forgiveness
If
you
aint
been
a
part
of
it
at
least
you
got
to
witness
bitches
Everever
Mr
West
is
in
the
building
Aint
no
question
who
about
to
kill
em
I
used
to
have
hood
dreams
Big
fame
big
chains
I
stuck
my
dick
inside
this
life
until
that
bitch
came
I
went
hard
all
fall
like
the
ball
teams
Just
so
I
can
make
it
rain
all
spring
Yall
seen
my
story
my
glory
I
had
raped
the
game
young
You
can
call
it
statutory
When
a
nigga
blow
up
they
gon
build
statues
for
me
Old
money
Benjamin
Button
What
Nothing
Now
super
bad
chicks
giving

McLovin
You

think
I
ran
the
world
like
Michelles
husband
You

when
they
really
doesnt
Like
they
was
down
with
the
old
me
no
you

Um

a
fucking
loser
He
didnt
even
go
to
class
Bueller
Trade
the
Grammy
plaques
just
to
have
my
granny
back
Remember
she
had
that
bad
hip
like
a
fanny
pack
Chasing
the
stardom
will
turn
you
to
a
maniac
All
the
way
in
Hollywood
and
I
cant
even
act
They
pull
their
cameras
out
and
goddamn
he
snap
I
used
to
want
this
thing
forever

can
have
it
back
OK
hello
its
the
Martian
Space
jam
Jordans
I
want
this
shit
forever
wake
up
and
smell
the
garden
Fresher
than
the
harvest
Step
up
to
the
target
If
I
had
one
guess
then
I
guess
Im
just
New
Orleans
And
I
will
never
stop
like
Im
running
from
the
cops
Life
is
such
a
fucking
roller
coaster
then
it
drops
But
what
should
I
scream
for
This
is
my
theme
park
My
mind
shine
even
when
my
thoughts
seem
dark
Pistol
on
my
side
you
dont
wanna
hear
that
thing
talk
Let
the
king
talk
check
the
price
and
pay
attention
Lil
Wayne
thats
what
they
gotta
say
or
mention
Im
like
Nevada
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
Im
resting
in
the
lead
I
need
a
pillow
and
a
cover
Shhh
my
foots
sleeping
on
the
gas
No
brake
pads
no
such
thing
as
last
uh
There
they
go
packing
stadiums
as
Shady
spits
his
flow
Nuts
they
go
macadamian
they
go
so
ballistic
whoa
He
can
make
them
look
like
Bozos
Hes
wondering
if
he
should
spit
this
slow
Fuck
no
Go
for
broke
His
cup
just
runneth
over
oh
no
He
aint
had
him
a
buzz
like
this
since
the
last
time
that
he
overdosed
Theyve
been
waiting
patiently
for
Pinocchio
to
poke
his
nose
Back
into
the
game
and
they
know
Rap
will
never
be
the
same
as
before
Bashing
in
the
brains
of
these
hoes
And
establishing
the
name
as
he
goes
The
passion
and
the
flame
is
ignited
You
cant
put
it
out
once
we
light
it
This
shit
is
exactly
what
the
fuck
that
Im
talking
about
when
we
riot
You
dealing
with
a
few
true
villains
Who
stand
inside
of
a
booth
truth
spilling
And
spit
true
feelings
until
our
tooth
fillings
come
flying
up
out
of
our
mouths
Now
rewind
it
Pay
back
motherfucker
for
the
way
that
you
got
at
me
hows
it
taste
When
I
slap
the
taste
out
your
mouth
with
the
bass
so
loud
that
it
shakes
the
place
Im
Hannibal
Lecter
so
just
in
case
youre
thinking
of
saving
face
You
aint
gonna
have
no
face
to
save
by

I

you
second

thats
a
hard
grind
cooking
Cause
my
pop
was
in
it
so
deep
If
his

these

would
probably
drop

Instead
I
drop
bars
like
Im
two
months
sober
Its

you
months
over
Yeah
if

I
find
me
a
way
to
get

Im
trying
to
get
to
the
point
where
I
can
sit
back
Took
a
lot
of
patience
and
action
I
grind
so
Im
anticipating
relaxing
Im
thinking
bout
replacing

I
dont

fillin
space
in

So
from

The

I

well
as
I

Bitches
checkin

every
where

Until
the
motherfucking
day
that
I
DIE
I
can
easily
makeem
admit
to
bounce
back
Without
knowing
exactly
where
my
accounts
at
Yeah
you
best
believe
that
I
often
tend
to
surpass
what
the
rest
achieve
So
they
dont
like
me
and
throw
parties
and
yet
they
never
invite
me
I
cant
lie
sometime
it
bother
me
slightly
Either
way
the
true
fans
yell
I
appear
calm
and
its
obvious
so
who
can
tell
And
no
this
aint
Blu
Cantrell
This
is
like
perfection
though
we
both
got
the
light
complexion
Couple
things
that
I
do
that
well
They
stay
kicking
it
with
me
like
a
field
goal
See
Im
humble
but
I
live
vain
With
more
deals
on
the

Just

that
these

just

And
they
never

But
I

you
gotta
chill
You
wanna
grip
a
Benz
wheel
And
I
know
you
cant
wait
You
dream
big
and
sleep
late
You
got
a
lot
on
your

Thats
why
youre
always
working
out
Taking
pictures
of
yourself
You
dont
see
anybody
else
Youre

oh
well
Youre

fuck

oh

My

You

The

you
never
bring
around
me
Cause
you
dont
trust
me

Did

Buy

Cause

a
lot
for

You

last
girl
I
just
pray
that
you
dont
let
me
down
right
now
Its
too

You

And
I

But

Falling
too
fast
Clearly
rules
dont
apply
Cant
believe
that
I
just
met
you
You
got
me
here
watching
minutes
pass
by
Wondering
when
to
expect
you
There
you
go
is
this
a
dream
Looking
like
every
picture
that
Ive
seen
of
you
before
Ive
seen
it
all
before
now
that
its
over
Should
have
known
better
Then
to
think
this
was
real
And
you
could
be
mine
Should
have
known
better
Slowed
it
down
Cause
I
feel
you
needed
time
But
I
kept
thinkin
Maybe
its
just
nothing
at
all
But
this
could
be
something
This
could
be
something
Maybe
its
just
nothing
at
all
Maybe
its
just
nothing
at
all
lyrics
I
did
it
all
on
my
own
Turned
a
chair
to
a
throne
Im
a
king
in
this
world
Stunt
hard
I
put
my
whole
city
on
To
some
things
that
they
never
wouldve
known
If
I
didnt
Stunt
hard
And
every
night
is
a
premiere
If
I
ever
dissapear
Best
believe
Im
comin
back
Stunt
hard
Got
rich
went
broke
and
got
rich
again
On
that
same
shit
again
All
I
ever
do
is
Stunt
hard
I
tell
her
Im
getting
motherfuckin
busy
So
many
spins
my
records
is
motherfuckin
dizzy
But
I
bet
a
million
she
tell
you
thats
motherfuckin
Drizzy
And
Im
focused
on
my
survival
Keep
an
eye
on
the
door
focus
on
my
arrival
Who
do
you
look
up
to
when
youre
better
then
your
idol
And
how
you
posed
to
look
when
you
do
it
with
your
eyes
closed
Im
everything
you
just
havent
become
I
spend
my
time
trying
to
outdo
what
hasnt
been
done
Now
hopefully
let
them
see
What
they
say
that
Im
gon
be
And
if
not
our
whole
future
does
in
the
memory
of
me
Get
your
team
in
order
assembly
is
key
And
all
my
niggas
shut
up
at
the
mention
of
a
plea
They
rather
be
apprehended
and
keep
quiet
then
to
be
On
the
stand
jeopardizing
every
inch
of
their
loyalty
Pick
a
lane
pick
a
lane
Thats
all
I
ever
heard
But
Im
just
trying
to
swerve
Without
hitting
the
curb
Thats
why
I
spend
thousands
on
bottles
so
I
can
pop
them
And
take
photos
wit
hater
niggas
and
crop
them
I
am

I

These

I
seem
to
think
About

I
have
failed
To
change
all
of
my
ways
These
days
Yeah
I
had
a
lover
Dont
think
Id
risk
another
These
days
These
days
And
if
I
seem
to
be
afraid
Just
listen
to
the
life
Ive
made
in
songs
These
days
Ive
stopped
the
dreaming
I
dont
do
too
much
scheming
These
days
These
days
I
sit
inside
chauffeur
car
With
windows
down
and
count
the
stars

In

I
have
to
watch
the
road
I
swear
that
every
car
that
passes
has
you
in
it
I
cant
believe
were
finished
My
life
is
movin
fast
The
time
will
often
pass
And
something
will
remind
me
I
cant
put
this
behind
me
I
thought
you
wouldve
called
by
now
by
now
You
couldve
had
my
all
by
now
by
now
Its
been
too
many
years
for
you
to
disappear
And
have
me
asking
the
question
I
wonder
whatever
became
of
you

Its
not
that
Im
surprised
its
not
I
didnt
try
Its
not
that
I
was
frightened
of
you
Although
I
said
all
goodbyes
And
you
had
all
your
cries
I
wonder
whatever
became
of
you
I
wonder
whatever
became
of
you
I
wonder
whatever
became
of
you
I
swear
I
heard
you
call
But
when
I
heard
youd
gone
I
hate
that
I
looked
desperate
You
gone
is
like
me
naked
Im
steering
not
to
crash
Trying
to
make
it
last
Keep
looking
close
behind
me
My
eyesight
on
a
memory
I
thought
you
wouldve
called
by
now
by
now
You
could
have
all
my
love
right
now
by
now
Gave
into
my
fears
While
you
just
disappeared
Thats
why
Im
asking
this
question
I
wonder
whatever
became
of
you

Its
not
that
Im
surprised
its
not
I
didnt
try
Its
not
that
I
was
frightened
of
you
Although
I
said
all
goodbyes
And
you
had
all
your
cries
I
wonder
whatever
became
of
you
I
wonder
whatever
became
of
you
I
wonder
whatever
became
of
you
I
cant
go
to
bed
Thinking
about
my
goals
And
how
we
used
to
say
a
goal
is
just
a
dream
with
a
deadline
Where
did
the
other
half
of
my
heart
go
Why
am
I
in
bed
alone
How
come
when
I
drive
by
it
looks
like
you
are
never
home
Do
you
even
live
there
Or
did
you
take
a
uhaul
Too
far
move
off
and
not
even
tell
me
that
youre
gone
We
were
on
fire
Somehow
that
fire
cooled
off
burnt
out
I
kept
straight
but
I
wonder
how
you
turned
out
I
wonder
whatever
became
of
you

Its
not
that
Im
surprised
its
not
I
didnt
try
Its
not
that
I
was
frightened
of
you
Although
I
said
all
goodbyes
And
you
had
all
your
cries
I
wonder
whatever
became
of
you
I
wonder
whatever
became
of
you
I
wonder
whatever
became
of
you
I
just
love
when
Im
with
you
yeah
this
shit
is
on
ten
We
used
to
be
friends
girl
and
even
back
then
You
would
look
at
me
with
no
hesitation
and
youd
tell
me
baby
its
yours
Nobody
elses
yeah
this
shit
belong
to
nobody
its
yours
Nobody
elses
yeah
this
shit
belong
to
nobody
and
that
What
made
me
think
about
the
game
girl
And
how
I
switched
it
up
with
a
new
thing
Young
nigga
came
through
on
his
WuTang
And
nowadays
when
I
ask
about
who
got
it
they
say
its
yours
Nobody
elses
yeah
this
shit
belong
to
nobody
its
yours
Nobody
elses
yeah
this
shit
belong
to
nobody
its

thats
for
sure

How
you
feel
about
coming
home
with
a
nigga
for
the
night
If
you
nervous
hit
the
lights
I
know
we
only
fucking
out
of
spite
Cause
your
man
dont
do
you
right
do
you
right
I
could
fuck
you
so
good
Then
I
hit
you
with
the
9
am
in
Dallas
who
you
like
baby
who
you
like
Tongue
kisses
stank
hoes
at
the
Coachella
Thank
the
Lord
she
never
listen
what
a
hoe
tell
her
Not
only
could
I
do
better
but
I
know
better
How
could
I
ever
be
the
king
without
a
Coretta
Feeling
like
Rae
same
damn
Lo
sweater
MAC
10
Beretta
for
the
cold
weather
Her
ex
let
her
blow
cheddar
she
a
go
getter
Hoe
clothes
fit
her
more
wetter
but
her
flow
better
Machine
gun
raps
for
all
my
niggas
in
the
back
Keep
machine
gun
strapped
in
case
a
nigga
wanna
act
up
Petite
gun
raps
aint
even
strong
enough
to
match
us
Machine
gun
BLAT
in
case
a
nigga
wanna
act
tough
Aint
nothing
like
a
bad
bitch
That
make
a
jiggy
nigga
wanna
go
and
run
up
in
that
shit
raw
Like
Brother
Man
from
the
5th
floor
I
creep
up
in
it
deep
up
in
it
til
she
tell
a
nigga
Its
yours
I
know
this
shit
is
mine
for
the
taking
If
I
aint
a
Mason
its
some
gay
shit
Prolly
why
I
dont
react
when
you
say
this
shit
Half
the
times
niggas
dont
even
make
sense
Know
this
shit
is
yours
When
you
do
a
world
tour
all
off
a
mixtape
shit
You
know
this
shit
is
yours
When
your
face
on
every
magazine
cover
every
page
shit
You
know
this
shit
is
yours
When
you
fuck
a
new
different
bad
broad
every
day
shit
Only
get
high
just
to
compliment
my
maintenance
I
took
a
little
moment
out
to
say
this
lyrics
Uhh
yea
Uh
uh
uh
Alright
well
alright
I
say
I
do
it
for
the
love
Bunk
bed
flow
Always
one
level
above
If
Im
in
your
starting
five
Youll
never
need
a
sub
And
Im
never
looking
down
So
I
always
know
watsup
A
picture
wont
do
me
justice
League
in
this
bitch
Ima
do
me
trust
this
Patience
little
label
nigga
you
wont
rush
this
I
got
the
hand
on
my
money
sweetie
you
cant
touch
this
I
got
a
revolutionary
flow
in
every
scenario
Coming
through
your
stereo
Bust
my
girlfriend
booty
round
like
the
merrygo
Bitches
like
where
he
at
they
be
like
there
he
go
And
this
verse
deserve
a
burial
Dont
cry
for
me
this

mafuckin
mario
Yea

my
session
Mr
anticipation
Ima

you
niggas

white
friends

But

Ill

your
battleship
capsize
Get
soaked

wet
get
baptized
I

the
full
package
a
nigga
complete
I
give
bread
and
eat
tracks
like
lunchmeat
Pursue
me
and
ill
put
you
on
front
street
Probably
get
your
record
pushed
back
like
front
seats
Im
much
more
than
youd
fathom
me
would
be
There
aint
too
many
niggas
Id
rather
be

me
I
guarantee
those
women
gettin
at
him
would
agree
That
he
should
go
ahead
put
a
patent
on
his
G
and
I
swear
these
niggas
gassed
up
even
tho
the
price
is
high
I
could
own
half
as
much
clothing
and
be
twice
as
fly
Yea
you
know
my
coupe
sits
super
low
Tops
slip
off
like
janet
at
the
superbowl
Ok
ok
Im
grown
grown
Party
at
my
house
but
Im
home
alone
Doing
every
single
thing
my
momma
wouldnt
condone
Counting
everything
I
own
in
my
mafucking
zone
Im
up
too
high
somebody
come
get
me
down

Down

Said
Im

too
high
somebody

get
me
down

Down
